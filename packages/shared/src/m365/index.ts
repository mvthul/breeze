// commsDigests is NOT exported here on purpose: it imports node:crypto, and this barrel
// is reachable from `@breeze/shared`'s root, which apps/web bundles for the browser.
// Import it as `@breeze/shared/m365/commsDigests`. Likewise commsPlanVectors is test-only
// data, reachable at `@breeze/shared/m365/commsPlanVectors`.
