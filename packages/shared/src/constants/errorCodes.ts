// Single source of truth for the machine-readable `code` field that rides
// alongside API error responses (see apps/api/src/lib/jsonError.ts) and the
// client-side translation seam in apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts.
//
// Values are the on-the-wire strings (SCREAMING_SNAKE): the API emits them in
// `{ error, code }` and the web resolves `errors:<CODE>` from them. Keeping the
// key and value identical means there is exactly one string to grep for across
// api + web + locale JSON, and no indirection to get wrong.
//
// This is ADDITIVE infrastructure only (Phase-3 Task 3): adopting these codes
// on individual routes is Task 4's job, done in waves. Nothing here changes an
// existing `error` prose string.
//
// Adding a code: add the line here, then add the matching key to BOTH
// apps/web/src/locales/en/errors.json and .../pt-BR/errors.json (the locale
// parity test enforces that the two files stay in sync).
