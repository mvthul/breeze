// Phase 2 wave P2-5 (#4192) — evidence ledger + graduation types.
//
// Every terminal outcome an agent produces (a released action intent, an
// act-mode manifest execution, a fix-watch verdict, a 👍/👎 on an alert
// verdict) writes exactly ONE immutable row into `ai_agent_op_evidence`,
// keyed by `(source_kind, source_id, metric)` so BullMQ redelivery can never
// double-count. `graduationService` (A2) reads that ledger over a trailing
// window and moves an `(org, agent, op_key)` tuple through
// `tracking → eligible → promoted → demoted → tracking`.
//
// See spec §4.5 (amended 2026-09-01, quorum) for the full design.
