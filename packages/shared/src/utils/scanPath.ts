/**
 * Scan-path normalisation for multi-volume filesystem analysis
 * (disk cleanup v2 spec §4).
 *
 * `device_filesystem_snapshots.scan_path` and the `(device_id, scan_path)`
 * primary key of `device_filesystem_scan_state` are keyed on the NORMALISED
 * form, so every producer and every reader has to agree byte for byte. `c:\`
 * and `C:\` are the same volume; keying them separately IS defect 6 — a
 * lower-cased drive never resumes its own checkpoint, and a `D:\` scan lands
 * on top of the `C:\` baseline.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IMPORTS NOTHING, on purpose. It is reachable from
 * `@breeze/shared`'s root barrel, which `apps/web` bundles, and
 * `browserSafeBarrel.test.ts` fails any module in that closure which imports a
 * Node builtin — `node:path` included. The rules below are the subset of
 * `path.win32.normalize` / `path.posix.normalize` that scan paths need,
 * implemented over plain strings.
 *
 * Rules (spec §4):
 *   Windows — separators become `\`, repeats collapse, the drive letter is
 *   upper-cased, and a trailing `\` survives ONLY on a volume root (`C:\`,
 *   `D:\`). A UNC path keeps exactly two leading separators so the volumes
 *   filter can recognise and refuse it.
 *   POSIX  — repeats collapse, `.`/`..` resolve, and a trailing `/` survives
 *   only on `/` itself.
 * Case below the drive letter is PRESERVED on both: `/Users` and `/users` are
 * different directories on a case-sensitive volume, and folding them would
 * silently merge two scans.
