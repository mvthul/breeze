# Breeze RMM — Automated Restore Verification (DR gap #6)
#
# Proves the off-region backup is actually restorable, on a schedule. Pulls the
# latest Postgres dump from the off-region Spaces bucket, restores it into a
# throwaway dockerized Postgres, asserts the data looks sane, then tears the
# scratch DB down. Designed to run weekly via cron and page on failure.
#
# This closes the "no proven backup restore" finding: backup.sh + restore.sh
# already work, but nothing exercised the restore path automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ops/restore-test.sh
#
# Environment variables (off-region source — same bucket offsite-backup.sh writes):
#   OFFSITE_S3_ENDPOINT       e.g. https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com  (required)
#   OFFSITE_S3_BUCKET         bucket name                               (required)
#   OFFSITE_S3_ACCESS_KEY     Spaces access key                         (required)
#   OFFSITE_S3_SECRET_KEY     Spaces secret key                         (required)
#   OFFSITE_S3_PREFIX         key prefix (default: db)
#   OFFSITE_S3_KEY            dump key to test (default: <prefix>/latest.dump, or
#                             <prefix>/latest.dump.gpg when encryption is enabled)
#   OFFSITE_BACKUP_GPG_PASSPHRASE
#                             if set, the downloaded artifact is gpg-decrypted
#                             before restore (must match offsite-backup.sh)
#
#   RESTORE_TEST_PG_IMAGE     postgres image (default: postgres:16)
#   RESTORE_TEST_MIN_DEVICES  minimum device rows to consider the restore sane
#                             (default: 1)
#   RESTORE_TEST_ALERT_URL    optional webhook (Slack/Alertmanager) POSTed on
#                             failure; if unset, failures only log + exit non-zero
#   RESTORE_TEST_HEARTBEAT_URL optional dead-man's-switch ping URL (e.g. a
#                             healthchecks.io check); pinged on each PASS so a
#                             silently-stopped cron (host down, creds expired,
#                             script removed) — which emits no failure — becomes
#                             the alarm via absence of the ping. Unset = no ping.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — restore verified
#   1 — restore ran but verification failed (data missing/short)
#   2 — could not run the test (missing dump, docker, env, etc.)
