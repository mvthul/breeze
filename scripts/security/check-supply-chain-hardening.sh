# The ~50 transitive pins in `pnpm.overrides` are hand-maintained and rot
# silently: a stale pin is indistinguishable from real coverage by inspection,
# so the tell-tale has been Trivy re-redding months later (#704, #2694, #2699,
# #2714, #2783). This asserts the pins still bind against the resolutions in
# pnpm-lock.yaml; it does not replace the advisory scanners (osv-scanner,
# Trivy), which are the only things that know a version is vulnerable.
# Run from here rather than as its own CI step so the guard travels with every
# caller of this script. See issue #2716.
