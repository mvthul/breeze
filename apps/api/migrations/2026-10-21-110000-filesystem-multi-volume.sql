-- Disk Cleanup v2 W02 — the scan-path axis for filesystem analysis (spec §4,
-- as amended by the Codex quorum findings in spec §13 #7, #8 and #18).
--
-- WHAT THIS FIXES (spec §2 defect 6). Scan state is keyed per DEVICE and
-- snapshots record no path, so a `D:\` scan resets the `C:\` baseline,
-- pollutes its hotDirectories, and becomes the "latest" snapshot that a `C:\`
-- cleanup preview then deletes from.
--
-- EXPAND ONLY (§13 #7). Every column added here is NULLABLE or defaulted, and
-- there is no primary key and no nullability contraction. An old API replica still
-- draining during the deploy supplies no `scan_path`; a NOT NULL column would
-- fail its snapshot INSERT with 23502 and lose a completed scan outright.
-- W03 ships the contract half — `2026-10-22-160000-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`
-- — once W02 is deployed everywhere.
--
-- SHIPS WITH ITS CODE. `upsertFilesystemScanState` uses
-- `onConflictDoUpdate({ target: deviceId })`; the single-column key is dropped
-- below, so that target names no unique index and every upsert raises 42P10.
-- The API release that carries this migration MUST also carry the writer
-- change. During a multi-replica window old replicas' snapshot inserts keep
-- working (the column is nullable) while their scan-state upserts fail with
-- 42P10 until they drain; a re-run scan repairs that state.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT. Every DDL statement is guarded and every backfill is gated on
-- `scan_path IS NULL`. No inner BEGIN/COMMIT: autoMigrate wraps each file in
-- one transaction.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Transient normalisation helper
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The SQL mirror of `normalizeScanPath(osType, path)` (packages/shared). Both
-- backfills below call it, so the two provably agree instead of carrying two
-- hand-copied CASE chains that can drift. Created and dropped inside this
-- migration: it is a migration-local tool, never part of the schema.
--
-- It does NOT resolve `.`/`..` — impractical set-based SQL. A recorded path
-- carrying a dot segment is returned UNCHANGED, which makes it inert (it
-- matches no normalised read) and lets the next scan supersede it.
-- Deliberately not re-keyed to the OS root, which would fold another volume's
-- cleanup candidates into the root preview.
--
-- A NULL or blank path yields the OS root, so `…(os_type, NULL)` is also how
-- the callers below spell "this device's OS root".
