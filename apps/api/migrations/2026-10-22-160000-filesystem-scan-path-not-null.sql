-- Disk Cleanup v2 W03 (spec §4, §13 #7) — the CONTRACT half of the expand/
-- contract pair. W02 added `scan_path` nullable, backfilled it, and gave
-- device_filesystem_scan_state a UNIQUE index on (device_id, scan_path) so an
-- old replica writing NULL during the rolling deploy could not fail. By the
-- time this runs, every replica writes the column.
--
-- Idempotent throughout: re-applying is a no-op.

-- Any write below runs as the table OWNER under FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY, and
-- breeze_current_scope() defaults to 'none' — without this the cleanup UPDATEs
-- match zero rows SILENTLY and the RAISE WARNING prints a truthful-looking 0.
SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);

-- Defensive: W02's backfill should have left nothing, but SET NOT NULL on a
-- table with one stray NULL aborts the whole migration. Repair and SAY SO —
-- a silent fix destroys the forensic trail (lesson from 2026-06-10-c).
