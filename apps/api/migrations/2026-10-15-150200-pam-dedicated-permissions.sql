-- Dedicated pam:approve / pam:manage_policy permissions, replacing the
-- generic devices:execute/devices:write grants PAM approve/deny and rule
-- authorship used to ride on (security review wave 7, SR1-13/SR1-14). An
-- ordinary technician holding devices:execute/write for routine device work
-- must not thereby be able to approve elevations or author the rules that
-- decide who gets standing admin automatically.
--
-- Grant predicate: copies 2026-10-08-100600-audit-retention-manage-permission.sql,
-- NOT 2026-09-03-ai-agents-permissions.sql. `r.name = 'Org Admin' AND
-- r.scope = 'organization' AND r.is_system = TRUE`, with NO
-- `partner_id IS NULL` clause: per-partner `is_system` Org Admin clones exist
-- in production (Org Admin roles are seeded per-partner, one row per
-- partner), so a global-template-only grant would reach nobody on upgrade.
-- `is_system = TRUE` is the anti-forgery filter — custom roles created via
-- routes/roles.ts are always `is_system = FALSE`, so this can never grant PAM
-- authority to an attacker-created role merely named "Org Admin".
--
-- Partner Admin already holds the wildcard '*:*' permission, so it needs no
-- explicit row here.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. permissions.id defaults to gen_random_uuid() at
-- the DB level (0001-baseline.sql), so no id is supplied on insert.
--
-- NOTE: permissions has NO UNIQUE constraint on (resource, action) — only a
-- primary key on id. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` therefore has nothing to
-- conflict against and would silently insert a duplicate on every re-apply.
-- Use an explicit existence check, matching
-- 2026-10-08-100600-audit-retention-manage-permission.sql.
--
-- Every write in this file (permissions/role_permissions seeding AND the
-- pam_rules quarantine below) runs under system scope: on a connection that
-- does not bypass RLS, an UPDATE/INSERT with no scope elected either matches
-- zero rows silently or aborts with 42501 (issue #4518). One `set_config` at
-- the top of the file covers the whole migration — `is_local = true` scopes
-- it to autoMigrate's per-file transaction.

-- Legacy auto_approve quarantine (§6B — amends the original plan's
