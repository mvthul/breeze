-- AI script authoring W04 (#5612): typed evidence for a decided_via =
-- 'script_reviewer' intent (spec §4.6 "Decision record").
--
-- The column is IMMUTABLE. action_intents_block_content_update() is a
-- DENY-LIST, not a wholesale block, so a new column is mutable unless named —
-- which is exactly how origin_principal_kind/_id once shipped with zero
-- immutability coverage. The definition below is 2026-10-14-100200's verbatim,
-- plus one line. The RAISE text is byte-identical on purpose:
-- src/testUtils/actionIntentsTriggerDenyList.ts anchors its parser on it.
--
-- Idempotent (ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS + CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION).
-- No inner BEGIN/COMMIT. Writes no rows.

ALTER TABLE action_intents
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS script_reviewer_evidence jsonb;
