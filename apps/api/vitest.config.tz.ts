// Targeted non-UTC pass over the auth/SSO/MFA-adjacent unit suites (#4046).
//
// GitHub-hosted runners default to UTC, and neither this repo's CI nor
// vitest.config.ts ever pins a different zone. A test written to assert
// timezone-correcting behavior (e.g. comparing an offsetless-timestamp-derived
// value against a UTC epoch) is dormant by construction when the host offset
// is exactly 0 — the assertion can collapse to `0 === 0` and stay green
// forever while the underlying conversion is missing or wrong. That is
// exactly how #4018's TZ bug (sso_sessions.created_at compared against
// auth_time without correcting for local-time parsing) shipped past 25,000+
// green tests and was only caught by a human review pass, then confirmed by
// re-running under TZ=America/Denver.
//
// This config re-runs just the auth/SSO/MFA/passkey suites — where that bug
// class lives — under a fixed non-UTC zone, so a future regression of the
// same shape fails CI instead of passing vacuously. It intentionally does
// NOT re-run the full suite a second time: that would double the cost of
// every unrelated test for no coverage gain, since only timestamp/timezone
// arithmetic is offset-sensitive.
//
// The TZ pin lives in the CI workflow step's `env:` block (runner-level, set
// before the Node process starts), not here and not in a test file — Node/V8
// cache the resolved timezone at first use of Date/Intl within a process, so
// assigning `process.env.TZ` from inside a test file (or a `beforeEach`) has
// no effect on already-initialized Date behavior in that worker. Run locally
// via `TZ=America/Denver pnpm test:tz` (or any non-UTC zone) from apps/api.

    // AUDIT NOTE (#4059 gap 2, 2026-09): the other schedulers named in that
    // issue — `services/automationRuntime.ts`/`services/cronDue.ts`
    // (`isCronDue`/`getZonedDateParts`), `jobs/patchSchedulerWorker.ts`
    // (`getLocalTimeParts` and friends) and `services/pamRuleEngine.ts`
    // (`isWithinTimeWindow`) — were audited and deliberately NOT added. They
    // are timezone-AWARE but host-timezone-INDEPENDENT: every one takes an
    // explicit IANA zone (defaulting to the 'UTC' sentinel, never the host
    // default) and resolves parts through `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, and their
    // existing suites pass explicit zone strings into every assertion. Re-running
    // them under a pinned zone is byte-identical to the UTC run, so it would
    // cost CI time for zero signal. `pamRuleEngine`'s `at` argument traces to
    // `elevation_requests.requested_at`, which IS `withTimezone: true`, so it
    // has no offsetless exposure either. What the audit DID find was two
    // offsetless-`timestamp` reads feeding instant arithmetic — registered
    // below. Re-audit if any of those files starts reading wall-clock parts off
    // a Date with bare local getters (`getHours`/`getDay`) or consumes a
    // `timestamp`-without-timezone column.
