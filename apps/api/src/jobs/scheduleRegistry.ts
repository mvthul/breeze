/**
 * Central slot registry for coarse (>= hourly) BullMQ repeatable schedules.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * BullMQ computes the next run of a `repeat: { every: N }` job as
 * `Math.floor(now / N) * N + N`. That is anchored to the Unix epoch, not to
 * process start, so every job registered with the same `every` value fires on
 * the same wall-clock boundary — forever. Because 86_400_000 ms divides the
 * epoch evenly, EVERY `every: 24h` job fires at exactly 00:00:00.000 UTC.
 *
 * On 2026-08-23 a read-only `ZRANGE` over the US production Redis showed 18 of
 * 97 repeat entries scheduled for the identical millisecond
 * (2026-08-24T00:00:00.000Z = 1787529600000). Eleven of them are batched
 * `DELETE ... LIMIT 10000` retention loops sharing the API's 30-connection
 * Postgres pool with live agent traffic. The nightly Sentry cluster
 * (CONNECTION_CLOSED / ECONNRESET around 00:01–00:02 UTC) is that pile-up
 * plus the 60-second tick jobs landing on an already-saturated pool.
 *
 * This module is the allocator: one entry per coarse repeatable schedule in
 * the API, including the ones whose defining file still spells the pattern
 * inline. `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` proves, against real source and
 * a real cron parser, that no coarse `every:` survives, that every coarse
 * pattern is allocated here exactly once, and that no two coarse schedules
 * ever fire in the same minute.
 *
 * MINUTE LANES
 * ------------
 * Minutes are allocated in lanes mod 5, because the *uncontrolled* schedules —
 * the 43 sub-hourly `every:` ticks this registry deliberately does not manage
 * (5s/30s/60s/2m/5m/10m/15m/30m sweeps) plus the every-5-minute and
 * every-10-minute cron ticks —
 * all land on minutes ≡ 0 (mod 5).
 *
 *   ≡ 3 (mod 5)  daily tier — the heavy batched-DELETE retention jobs
 *   ≡ 2 (mod 5)  sub-daily tier — cheap hourly / 6-hourly sweeps
 *   ≡ 0 (mod 5)  left to the unmanaged fine-grained ticks
 *
 * Three legacy sub-daily slots (:00, :15, :35) predate the lanes and are not
 * worth churning; they are collision-checked like everything else.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — what this does NOT fix
 * -------------------------------------
 * The 43 sub-hourly `every:` registrations are exempt by design: a 60-second
 * tick has to fire every 60 seconds, and re-anchoring it buys nothing. They
 * are still epoch-aligned, so the 5/10/15/30-minute jobs *do* all converge on
 * 00:00:00.000 alongside each other. The production ZRANGE that motivated this
 * work was taken mid-day and structurally could not show them. Midnight is
 * therefore quieter, not empty — what changed is that the heavy daily batch
 * deletes are no longer part of the convergence.
 *
 * ALLOCATING A NEW SLOT
 * ---------------------
 * Add a key below with a cron pattern, then use `jobSchedule('<key>')` in the
 * `repeat: { pattern }` of the registration. Pick a free minute in the lane for
 * your tier — the contract test tells you if you collided. Do NOT reach for
 * `every:` for anything an hour or coarser.
 *
 * All patterns are interpreted in the container's local timezone, which is UTC
 * on every Breeze deployment. (`repeat.tz` is not pinned; a self-hoster who
 * sets a non-UTC `TZ` shifts the whole grid coherently, so the collision
 * guarantees hold, but absolute times move.)
