/**
 * Fixed-tick sweeper for `ai_agent_schedules` (Phase 2 wave P2-2, task 9).
 *
 * Two job shapes on ONE queue (`ai-agent-sweep`):
 *
 *  - `tick` — a repeatable job every `SWEEP_TICK_INTERVAL_MS`. Scans every
 *    ENABLED partner baseline whose agent is enabled, asks
 *    `latestCronOccurrence` for the most recent minute that baseline's cron
 *    was due at, and enqueues ONE `occurrence` job per baseline that has a
 *    new occurrence. Deliberately NOT a per-schedule BullMQ repeatable: a
 *    partner can create, re-cron and delete schedules at will, and keeping a
 *    Redis repeatable in sync with a mutable config table is the class of
 *    problem that produces orphaned repeatables nobody can find. One fixed
 *    tick over the table is always consistent with the table.
 *
 *  - `occurrence` — the fan-out. Re-reads the baseline (it may have been
 *    disabled or deleted, or its agent soft-deleted, since the tick), merges
 *    each org's tighten-only override through `effectiveSchedule`, and admits
 *    one run per org through `createAndEnqueueAgentRun` — `profile: 'sweep'`
 *    for a `kind: 'sweep'` baseline, `profile: 'narrative'` for a
 *    `kind: 'narrative'` one (P2-3, the weekly org narrative). Everything
 *    else about the occurrence — the cadence, the CAS, the org enumeration,
 *    the cap, the skip tally, the aggregate-only `last_run_summary` — is
 *    identical for both kinds.
 *
 * ## Idempotency: jobId first, CAS second
 *
 * The tick's order is load-bearing and must not be "tidied" into a single
 * transaction:
 *
 *   1. compute the occurrence key;
 *   2. skip when it equals `last_occurrence_key` (this tick already ran it);
 *   2b. skip when the occurrence predates the schedule's own `created_at` —
 *      a brand-new baseline has a NULL key, so without this it would catch up
 *      on the occurrence that passed BEFORE it existed (#6201);
 *   3. `queue.add('occurrence', …, { jobId })` — `getSweepOccurrenceJobId` is
 *      a pure function of (scheduleId, key), and BullMQ SILENTLY NO-OPS an add
 *      whose jobId is already present;
 *   4. THEN `UPDATE … SET last_occurrence_key = $key WHERE id = $id AND
 *      last_occurrence_key IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $previous` — a compare-and-set
 *      so two replicas ticking together do not both claim the occurrence. Zero
 *      rows updated means the other replica won, which is fine: it added the
 *      same jobId.
 *
 * A crash between (3) and (4) leaves the key unstamped, so the next tick
 * recomputes the SAME key and re-adds the SAME jobId — BullMQ no-ops, the CAS
 * lands. The reverse order (stamp first, add second) would lose the occurrence
 * entirely on the same crash.
 *
 * **The jobId is a cheap first line of defence, NOT the exactly-once guard.**
 * BullMQ only rejects a duplicate id while a job with that id still exists in
 * Redis, so once the completed job ages out of `removeOnComplete` retention the
 * same id can be added again. The durable guarantee is one level down: every
 * run the fan-out admits carries `dedupeKey = sweep-<scheduleId>-<orgId>-<key>`
 * and `ai_agent_runs_org_dedupe_key_uq` is what actually makes a replayed
 * occurrence a no-op (proven against real Postgres in
 * `aiAgentSweepFanout.integration.test.ts`). Retention is nevertheless kept
 * well above one tick interval (`removeOnComplete: { count: 200 }`) so the id
 * survives the window in which a re-add is even plausible.
 *
 * ## Worker shape — one worker, not two (deviation, deliberate)
 *
 * The task brief called for two workers on this queue, "`tick` concurrency 1,
 * `occurrence` concurrency 2". BullMQ workers cannot filter by job NAME —
 * every worker on a queue receives every job on it — so two workers would
 * each have to handle both shapes, and the split would deliver neither a tick
 * singleton nor an occurrence budget: it would be total concurrency 3 under
 * two misleading names. One worker with the same total budget (3) and a
 * name dispatcher is the honest form of the same thing. The tick's
 * single-flight property comes from the repeatable `jobId` plus the CAS
 * above, never from worker concurrency.
 *
 * ## Gating
 *
 * The worker and the repeatable registration are unconditional (the
 * `alertVerdictScheduler.ts` convention): only the PRODUCER — the tick's
 * `queue.add` — is gated on `AI_AGENTS_ENABLED`, so flipping the platform
 * kill switch back on resumes sweeping without a process restart, and an
 * install with agents off never fills the queue. `createAndEnqueueAgentRun`
 * re-checks the same switch at call time, so the occurrence path is covered
 * even for a job that was enqueued before the switch was thrown.
 *
 * Registered in `services/workerRegistry.ts` as `global`. That is NOT an
 * assumption copied from a sibling: `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`
 * (the mechanical authority) was run for BOTH values, and this module's
 * runtime import closure reaches neither `routes/agentWs.ts` nor
 * `services/agentCommandAwait.ts`. `alertVerdictScheduler` — same job shape,
 * `socket-owner` placement — reaches them only through
 * `alertVerdictSubscriber` -> `aiToolsOrgs` -> `tenantOffboarding` ->
 * `orgMerge` -> `routes/portal/helpers`, none of which this module imports.
 * The deepest AI dependency here is `createAndEnqueueAgentRun`, which inserts
 * a run row and enqueues; socket dispatch happens later, in `aiAgentRunner`.
 * Do not relitigate the value by reasoning about it — run the tool.

 *
 * The returned (and stored) `last_run_summary` is AGGREGATE ONLY — counters
 * and a skip-reason histogram, never an org id or name. A partner baseline is
 * legible to each of its orgs through the effective resolver
 * (`scheduleService.listSchedules` strips the summary for them, but the
 * column is one migration away from being surfaced), so "org X was skipped
