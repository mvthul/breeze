/**
 * Attaches unified error + failed-job reporting to a BullMQ worker (#1379).
 *
 * Many workers historically only `console.error`'d on `error`/`failed`, so
 * job failures were invisible in Sentry — a class of silent failure this
 * wires up. Purely additive: callers keep any existing `.on('error')` /
 * `.on('failed')` handlers; this just adds Sentry capture alongside.
 */
/**
 * Run each job inside a Sentry isolation scope tagged with the worker and job
 * identity, so EVERY event captured while that job runs inherits them — not
 * just the `failed` handler below.
 *
 * Why: the `worker` tag was only ever set on the 'failed' listener, which fires
 * outside job execution. Anything captured *during* a job — most importantly the
 * #1105 held-context warning from withDbAccessContext — arrived with no
 * attribution at all. BREEZE-9 accumulated ~12k held-context events at
 * scope=system whose `worker` tag is empty, so there was no way to tell which
 * worker is pinning connections. Breaking that issue down by worker is the whole
 * triage step, and it was impossible.
 *
 * Every worker already calls attachWorkerObservability, so patching here covers
 * every one with no per-worker change.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED IN PART (BREEZE-18, 2026-08-23) — read before trusting the
 * paragraph above. The reasoning is correct but was not the whole story, and
 * this patch has been INERT since two days after it landed. `3c92c07cd`
 * (2026-07-25) added it; `a50769487` (2026-07-27, security wave 7) then
 * introduced ALLOWED_TAG_NAMES in services/sentry.ts, which rebuilds every
 * outbound event's tags through an allowlist that did not contain `worker`. So
 * the tag was set correctly here and deleted on the way out — by both paths,
 * the isolation scope AND the 'failed' listener below.
 *
 * That is why the ~12k BREEZE-9 events kept arriving unattributed after this
 * shipped. `worker` is allowlisted as of BREEZE-18; if you are debugging empty
 * worker attribution again, check ALLOWED_TAG_NAMES before this file.
 *
 * `processFn` is a BullMQ instance property (visible in production stack traces
 * as `at Worker.processFn`). Patching a library internal is a trade: it is
 * guarded by a typeof check so a BullMQ rename degrades to the previous
 * behaviour — no tags — rather than throwing, and workerObservability.test.ts
 * asserts the tagging works so an upgrade that moves it fails loudly in CI
 * instead of silently returning us to unattributable events.

 *

 *   3. a custom backoff strategy returned -1. That is NOT modelled: the
