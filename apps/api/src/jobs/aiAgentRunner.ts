/**
 * aiAgentRunner — the `ai-agent` BullMQ CONSUMER shell (AI agents wave 3c;
 * split from the producer side in wave 3.5d-b, #4086).
 *
 * This module owns DURABILITY for headless agent runs, and nothing else. The
 * decision to run at all is made by `services/aiAgents/runService.ts`
 * (`createAndEnqueueAgentRun`), which commits the `ai_agent_runs` row and then
 * hands the run id to the producer; the run loop itself lives in
 * `services/aiAgents/runLoop.ts` and is re-exported below as `executeAgentRun`.
 *
 * The enqueue side (`enqueueAgentRunJob`, the queue singleton, and explicit
 * registration with `runService` via `registerAiAgentEnqueuer()`) now lives in
 * `./aiAgentEnqueuer.ts` — split out so a process can register the enqueuer
 * without importing this consumer graph (see that file's header comment for
 * why). The symbols below are re-exported here for backward compatibility.
 *
 * One property is still load-bearing and deliberately unlike the other
 * workers:
 *
 * **No retries** (`attempts: 1`, no backoff). A crashed agent run may have
 * already invoked tools; replaying it would re-invoke them with no human in
 * the loop. The run row's `failed` status IS the retry surface — a person
 * re-triggers it.

 * `designWallClockSeconds`, whose default now sits at that ceiling), so this
 * is sized off 1800s rather than 600s (was 720_000, i.e. 600s+120s). 1800s +
 * 180s teardown/skew buffer = 1_980_000ms.
 *
 * `runService.ts`'s `STALLED_RUN_AFTER_SECONDS` (2700s = 1800s + 900s) is the
 * admission-side reaper for a run whose worker crashed outright; it was
 * already sized off the 1800s validator ceiling and comfortably exceeds this
 * lock duration, so it needs no change here.
