 * Durable release worker (spec

 * §5 / §10.3 / §8) — consumes `intent_approved` jobs off the `action-intents`
 * BullMQ queue (populated by `jobs/intentOutboxPublisher.ts`) and, for each,
 * re-validates the approval is still good and RE-EXECUTES the tool through a
 * freshly rebuilt actor identity.
 *
 * SECURITY-CRITICAL trust boundary: a reconstructed identity is about to
 * execute a real, privileged Tier-3 action on behalf of a decision made
 * possibly minutes to (for `mcp_api` intents) a day earlier. Every step below
 * is fail-closed — any doubt CASes the intent straight to `failed` with a
 * categorized `error_code` and skips execution entirely. Never a silent
 * no-op, never a downgrade to "execute anyway."
 *
 * Job data: `{ intentId, eventType }`. `eventType === 'intent_approved'` is
 * the release trigger; `intent_created` is the wave 5 Part B (#3827)
 * policy-decide recovery hook (NOT flag-gated at this call site —
 * `attemptPolicyDecision` itself is the single source of truth for flag-off
 * inertness, see its own header); anything else is acknowledged as a no-op.
 *
 * CAS-idempotent by construction: the `approved -> executing` transition at
 * step 1 is a single-use release guard (mirrors the PAM `actuating` pattern).
 * A duplicate delivery of the same job (BullMQ jobId dedupe normally
 * prevents this, but retries happen) finds the intent already
 * `executing`/terminal, the CAS returns zero rows, and the handler exits
 * without calling `executeTool` a second time.

 * that transaction.
 *
 * **The evidence write is the side that yields.** The ledger is a grading
 * side-channel; the terminal state is the record of a real-world side effect
 * and outranks it. If an insert failure (a 23503 on the `agent_id` or the
 * composite `(run_id, org_id)` FK, a CHECK, a transient error) were allowed
 * to propagate, it would unwind an `executing -> completed` CAS for an action
 * that ALREADY RAN: the throw escapes `releaseApprovedIntent`, BullMQ
 * redelivers, the claim CAS `approved -> executing` loses because the row is
 * still `executing`, and the stale-executing reaper terminalizes it
 * `failed:execution_lost` — a successful action permanently recorded as a
 * failure, with no result stored, no success audit and no notification. So a
 * failure here rolls back to the SAVEPOINT and is captured, never rethrown.
 * The happy path is still a single atomic commit, which is what the plan
 * asks for; only the losing side changed.
 *
 * The SAVEPOINT must actually RECEIVE the statements, which is why the
 * executor is threaded explicitly instead of using the ambient `db` proxy:
 * postgres-js records the first failed query of a transaction scope in that
 * scope's `uncaughtError` and rethrows it when the scope ends, EVEN IF the
 * caller caught the rejection (`postgres/src/index.js`'s `scope()`), so a
 * statement issued through the OUTER scope would abort the outer transaction
 * no matter how it is wrapped. `insertOpEvidence`'s second parameter exists
 * for exactly this.
 *
 * Only AGENT-originated intents produce evidence: a human/chat/MCP release
 * has no agent to grade, and `requesting_agent_run_id` is the column that
 * says so. The run row is loaded predicated by BOTH `id` AND `org_id` (RLS
 * passes unconditionally under a system context, so the org predicate is the
 * real isolation here), which also yields the EFFECTIVE agent id the run
 * recorded — `ai_agent_runs.agent_id` is the partner-baseline row, which is
 * exactly the grain graduation tracks. A run that is not readable in this
 * org writes nothing rather than guessing an agent id.
 *
 * `alert_id` rides along on the same read: the released-intent fix watch
 * (Task 5) is anchored to the triggering alert and must not pay for a second
 * round trip inside the same transaction. That is what the RETURN value is —
 * the anchor `watchReleasedIntent` needs. It is null whenever no ledger row
 * was written (a human intent, an unreadable run, or a failed insert), which
 * deliberately suppresses the watch too: a `verified` / `recurred` row whose
 * `executed` counterpart never landed would read to `graduationService` as a
 * verification of an operation that never happened.
 *
 * Leak rules: identifiers only — `op_key`, ids, timestamps. Never a tool
 * result, an error message, or any model-authored text.

 * Three outcomes, and the difference between them is the whole point:
 *  - a watch row exists → return its id; the watch will grade this operation
 *    `verified` or `recurred` (Task 6), so nothing is credited now;
 *  - no watch is POSSIBLE (the run has no triggering alert AND the intent
 *    names no probeable sweep subject, or that alert is no longer readable in
 *    this org) → credit `verified` on the same source id, in the same
 *    transaction. C4: an operation no watch will ever look at must not sit
 *    un-gradeable forever;
 *  - the attempt FAILED → credit nothing. An operation whose verification
 *    lane was lost is not "verified", and the ledger is immutable.
 *
 * #5751 W02 (#5753) NARROWED the middle branch. Its premise — "no watch is
 * possible" — stopped being true for sweep-minted intents: a sweep run has no
 * triggering alert, but a sweep FINDING has a subject, and a subject can be
 * re-probed. Until the sweep arm below existed, every sweep-minted intent fell
 * straight through to the `verified` credit, which made P2-5's graduation
 * ladder a click-counter for the whole sweep lane (spec §1.1). The fallback is
 * narrowed, NOT removed — it still stands for everything else.

 * 1. `executed: true` MUST be passed to `failIntent` so `executedAt` gets

 *    action class where "did the reset actually happen" matters most. It
 *    would also delay any signal at all for up to the reaper's full sweep
 *    window instead of failing immediately.
 * 2. No `result` (i.e. not the guarded value itself) is ever passed as
 *    `details` — `failIntent` already never sets `result`, and this
 *    deliberately omits it from `details` too, so neither the intent's
 *    `result` column nor the audit event's `details` column can carry the
 *    plaintext this guard exists to keep out of both. `err.message` IS safe

  // "send quote <id>"), and the referenced content can drift during the
  // approval window while the intent's own arguments stay byte-identical.
  //
  // That window is NOT one number. `computeExpiresAt`
  // (services/actionIntents/intentService.ts) keys it off SOURCE first and
  // approval scope only second:
  //   - `CHAT_EXPIRY_MS` (5 min)            — source `chat`, supervised
  //   - `FOUR_EYES_CHAT_EXPIRY_MS` (60 min) — source `chat`, four_eyes

  //                                           whatever the scope

  // `mcp_api` four_eyes intent), not an hour — matching this file's header

  // tool/action at creation (`not_applicable`), or a resolver existed but
  // couldn't resolve the target (`unresolved` — legacy pre-pinning rows, or a
  // missing/deleted target); both skip this check by design. Approval scope
  // is NOT a factor: pinning is scope-independent (changed 2026-08-06, see
  // effectDigest.ts's header) — a SUPERVISED intent whose tool has a
  // resolver (run_script is the flagship case) IS pinned and DOES run this
  // check below, same as a four_eyes intent. It used to be skipped for every
  // supervised intent when pinning was gated on
  // `approvalScope === 'four_eyes'`; that gate is gone — don't assume it's
  // still there and conclude this branch is unreachable for supervised.
  // `hasPinnedDigest` is the SHARED predicate with the inline chat release
  // path (services/aiAgentSdk.ts): the two previously guarded the same
  // invariant with different predicates (`!== null` here, truthiness there),
  // which diverged on `undefined` (a narrower select shape) — this path
  // failed CLOSED (a recompute never equals `undefined`, so EVERY pinned
  // release would have been content_changed) while the SDK failed OPEN

/**
 * The identity of an outcome notification, for dedupe purposes — deliberately
 * NOT the raw status (#4465).
 *
 * One autonomy intent carries TWO outbox rows (`intent_created` and
 * `intent_approved`, both written by `createActionIntent`), so
 * `releaseAndNotify` runs twice for it by design — the second is a backstop
 * for the first — and outbox delivery is at-least-once on top of that. The
 * release itself is CAS-guarded and safely idempotent; this key is the only
 * thing that makes the NOTIFICATION idempotent too. Keying it on
 * `intent.status` broke that the moment the status advanced between the two
 * reads (the CAS loser observes `approved` while the winner is still
 * executing; the winner then observes `completed`), ringing the bell twice
 * for one outcome.
 *
 * Collapsing to a class keeps the property the status key was protecting — a
 * later, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT outcome must still be able to correct an earlier
 * one — without paying a bell for each intermediate observation of the same
 * one:
 *
 * | status          | class       | shares a key with `granted`? | why                                                             |
 * |-----------------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | approved        | `granted`   | —                            | approved; execution pending                                     |
 * | executing       | `granted`   | yes (silent)                 | same outcome, later observation                                 |
 * | completed       | `granted`   | yes (silent)                 | same outcome, settled as expected                               |
 * | failed          | `failed`    | no (corrects it)             | approved but did NOT run — the earlier "is now running" was wrong |
 * | rejected        | `rejected`  | no                           | terminal negative decision                                      |
 * | cancelled       | `cancelled` | no                           | terminal, withdrawn                                             |
 * | expired         | `expired`   | no                           | terminal, nobody decided                                        |
 * | anything else   | `update`    | no                           | unknown/pending — say only what is certain, and never share a key with a real outcome |
 *
 * "no" means only that the two do not share a key — not that both bells
 * normally ring. `rejected` genuinely cannot follow `granted` (a rejected
 * intent is never released), but `cancelled` CAN:
 * `cancelActionIntent` transitions from `['pending_approval', 'approved']`
 * (intentService.ts), so an approver can withdraw an intent that already rang
 * a `granted` bell. `granted` -> `failed` and `granted` -> `cancelled` are
 * therefore both real corrections that must survive the dedupe.
 *
 * #4798: `cancelActionIntent` now writes its own `intent_cancelled` outbox row
 * (in the same transaction as the CAS, mirroring `intent_created` /
 * `intent_approved`) instead of relying solely on a late delivery of some
 * OTHER event (e.g. an `intent_expired` row processed after the cancel
 * landed) to surface the correction. Keeping `cancelled` in its own class is
 * what makes both paths — the dedicated event and a stale late delivery —
 * able to correct an earlier `granted` bell without duplicating it.
 *
 * Every unknown status shares the one `update` key on purpose: they all render
 * the same "changed state" copy, so a second one is noise, not news.
 *
 * Repeating the SAME class always dedupes — that is what makes the intentional
 * duplicate delivery silent.
