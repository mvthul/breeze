  // must keep expiring, or an abuse suspension reversed days later would
  // deliver stale uninstalls to a reinstated fleet. The offboarding drain
  // reaper cancels these rows itself (with a never-drained report) when the
  // window closes, so they cannot linger past the drain either.
  //
  // #3986 Task 10 — a SECOND, independent arm for the device-remove drain
  // (deviceUninstallDrain.ts). Three features queue a self_uninstall row:
  // device remove (this arm), tenant offboarding (the arm above), and abuse
  // suspension (routes/admin/abuse.ts, no status filter — it queues
  // self_uninstall onto already-decommissioned devices too). The exemption
  // below therefore keys on the explicit `device_remove` reason PLUS an
  // unexpired deadline, never on devices.status alone: a status-only or
  // bare-self_uninstall predicate would sweep up the abuse rows, hold them
  // for the drain window, and on un-suspension deliver a fleet-wide
  // uninstall to a reinstated customer. This arm deliberately does NOT
  // reuse the EXISTS/JOIN above — that join is INNER on partners, so an org
  // with partner_id IS NULL silently drops out of the EXISTS (a known gap
  // in the offboarding arm) — this arm needs no join at all, so it can't
  // inherit that bug. When the deadline passes the row reaps normally, the
  // device stops satisfying the drain predicate, and agentAuth's 30-minute
  // window reverts to a hard 403 on its own; no new sweeper needed.
  //
  // NULL-SAFETY (`COALESCE(..., FALSE)`) IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DEFENSIVE POLISH.
  // Both halves of the device-remove arm are NULL for exactly the rows this
  // exemption must never cover: `NULL @> ARRAY['device_remove']` is NULL (not
  // false), and `NULL > now()` is NULL. `TRUE AND NULL AND NULL` is NULL, so
  // the whole disjunction goes NULL and `NOT NULL` is NULL — and a NULL WHERE
  // term does not match, which drops the row from the reaper's candidate set
  // ENTIRELY. Unguarded, that inverts the arm's meaning for every
  // reason-less self_uninstall: abuse.ts's fleet-wide suspension rows and
  // every row predating the provenance column would become permanently
  // un-reapable, sit `pending` forever, and deliver on the first heartbeat
  // after an un-suspension — precisely the incident this arm's own comment
  // says it prevents. Caught by deviceUninstallDrain.integration.test.ts's
  // incident guard; a compiled-SQL unit assertion cannot see it, because the
  // clause SHAPE is correct and only Postgres's three-valued evaluation of it
  // is not.
  // DELIBERATE PREDICATE DRIFT, recorded so nobody "fixes" it into a bug:
  // this arm omits the `devices.status = 'decommissioned'` conjunct that
  // `isDeviceUninstallDraining` (services/deviceUninstallDrain.ts) requires,
  // so it is strictly LOOSER than the auth-side predicate. That is safe, and
  // the safe direction is the only one available here:
  //
  //   - Looser here means a row can be EXEMPT from reaping while the device
  //     is not (yet, or any longer) `decommissioned`. Exemption only leaves a
  //     `pending` row alive; it never grants authentication or delivery. The
  //     narrower auth predicate still 403s such a device, and the row's own
  //     deadline still expires it, so the exemption self-closes with no
  //     sweeper.
  //   - Tighter here would be the dangerous direction: the reaper would time
  //     out a self_uninstall that `agentAuth` is still holding a live drain
  //     window open for, and the removed machine would authenticate for the
  //     rest of the window with nothing left to collect — the uninstall
  //     silently never delivered.
  //
  // The set where they differ is empty in practice anyway: only
  // `queueDeviceUninstall` writes the `device_remove` reason, and it runs
  // inside the caller's decommission transaction, so a row carrying that
  // reason and a future deadline belongs to a `decommissioned` device. A
  // restore strips BOTH the reason and the deadline in one UPDATE (see
  // `releaseDeviceRemoveReason`), which drops the row out of this arm at the
  // same instant it drops out of the auth predicate. Joining `devices` here
  // purely to re-derive that would add a per-row join to the hot reaper scan
  // for no reachable behaviour change.

 *
 * Owns the `cancelling` state EXCLUSIVELY. `reapStaleScriptExecutions` above is
 * deliberately blind to it (its predicate is `pending|queued|running` and stays
 * that way), because the two reapers answer different questions: that one asks
 * "did the script finish in time", this one asks "did the cancel REQUEST get
 * resolved". Widening the first to cover `cancelling` would make a failed
 * cancel look like a failed script.
 *
 * Nothing here terminalises a row as `cancelled` — only proof does, and proof
 * arrives through the agent's ack (`applyScriptCancelAck`) or the original
 * script result. This sweep only ever REVERTS `status` to the value the
 * execution held when the cancel was requested and records `unconfirmed`. That
 * hands ownership straight back to `reapStaleScriptExecutions`, whose predicate
 * the reverted status is inside, so a failed cancel can never strand a row.
 *
 * Three ways a cancel gets resolved here:
 *
 *  - the cancel command reached a terminal status (closer 4 — its own 2-hour
 *    LONG_TIMEOUT tier expired it, or an ack landed that resolved nothing);
 *  - it was DELIVERED more than `CANCEL_GRACE_MS` ago (closer 5). The clock
 *    starts at delivery (`device_commands.executed_at`), never at the request:
 *    losing the WS connection does not kill the agent or its script, so a
 *    cancel queued against an offline device is still deliverable on reconnect
 *    and must not be given up on early;
 *  - the cancel command row is GONE. `script_executions.cancel_command_id` is a
 *    bare uuid precisely because command rows are reaped independently, and
 *    once the row is gone neither of the two clocks above can ever fire again.
 *    Bounded by `cancel_requested_at` so that the write window between stamping
 *    an execution `cancelling` and its command row becoming visible cannot
 *    revert a cancel that is still being dispatched.

/**
 * Reap stale System-A software deployment result rows (`deployment_results`)

 *
 *  DELIVERED BUT SILENT: the install command provably reached the agent — the
 *  linked `device_commands` row is 'sent'/'completed', or there is no linked
 *  row at all (pre-#5128 WS dispatches, which created none) — and more than
 *  SOFTWARE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS has passed SINCE DELIVERY.
 *
 * #5128 — two corrections here:
 *
 *  1. The "delivered but silent" clock now measures from the command's
 *     `executed_at` (the instant the agent CLAIMED it), not the deployment's
 *     `dispatched_at`. Measuring from dispatch timed out an install that was
 *     delivered three days later on the reaper's very next pass, purely
 *     because the device had been offline in between.
 *  2. The old Tier 2 ("queued, never delivered", expiring at a flat 7 days from
 *     dispatch) is GONE. Undelivered work belongs to exactly one clock owner —
 *     `reapStaleDeviceCommands`, which expires the row at its own `deliver_by`
 *     and propagates the outcome through `propagateTimedOutDeviceCommand`.
 *     Two independent reapers racing on the same undelivered row is what made
 *     "queued — device offline" unreliable in the first place.
 *
 * Rows whose deployment has `dispatched_at` NULL (scheduled, not yet
 * dispatched) are NEVER candidates — the SQL filter excludes them.
