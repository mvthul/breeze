 * This sweep finds `scheduled` rows whose intended run time has passed (plus a

 * re-enqueues them, preserving any remaining delay. `enqueuePatchJob` is
 * idempotent on the stable jobId, and `processExecutePatchJob` re-checks
 * `status='scheduled'` under a conditional UPDATE, so re-enqueuing a job that is
 * actually fine (or already running) is a safe no-op.
 *
 * The window is keyed off `scheduledAt`, NOT `createdAt`: the POST creation
 * route (`configurationPolicies/patchJobs.ts`) lets an operator schedule a job
 * for a future `scheduledAt` and enqueues it with a matching BullMQ delay. If we
 * gated on `createdAt`, a future-scheduled row whose delayed enqueue was lost
 * would become "stale" 2 minutes after creation and the sweep would re-enqueue
 * it with no delay — firing the patch run up to 45 days early. `scheduledAt` is
 * nullable; scheduler rows always set it to the run time, and we COALESCE to
 * `createdAt` for any legacy/null row so it stays recoverable.
 *
 * Split into two phases so the caller can keep the DB read inside its system DB
 * access context and the Redis round-trips outside it (#1105):
 *   1. selectStaleScheduledJobIds — DB-only; the scheduled rows past the grace
