/**
 * AI artifact DOWNLOAD (execution-plane spec §5.2, §8).
 *
 * The per-run LISTING is deliberately NOT here: it is
 * `GET /ai/agents/runs/:runId/artifacts`, and it is registered inside
 * `aiAgentsRoutes` (routes/aiAgents.ts) beside the run detail it shares a
 * prefix with. Mounting a second Hono app at `/ai/agents` would make the
 * precedence between the two depend on mount order in index.ts, invisible from
 * either router — the shape of #4189.
 *
 * RBAC is identical to `GET /ai/agents/runs/:runId`: the same scope set, the
 * same ai_agents:read permission, org scoping through `auth.orgCondition`, and
 * a BARE 404 on every miss. A handle is opaque, so "exists but not yours" must
 * be indistinguishable from "does not exist" — there is deliberately no 403
 * branch in this handler.
 *
 * RENDERING (§8): every response is `Content-Disposition: attachment` plus
 * `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and the content type comes from the fixed
 * map below — NEVER from the stored string. This is stricter than the ticket
 * attachment route, which serves images inline: an artifact is model- or
 * sandbox-produced content, and no artifact is ever rendered by a browser in a
 * Breeze origin. Bytes are streamed through the API rather than handed out as a
 * presigned redirect, because streaming is the only way to force these two
 * headers on every storage provider.
