/**
 * The Partner API was read-only by construction until #3243 — every route was
 * a `.get()`, and "this surface cannot mutate tenancy" was verifiable with a
 * grep. Issue #3243 deliberately gave it a write side (unattended tenancy
 * provisioning for migrations and integrations), which destroyed that cheap
 * invariant. This allowlist is its stronger replacement: every non-GET route
 * registered under `partnerApiRoutes` must appear here as a deliberate,
 * reviewable line, so a future write route cannot slip in as a side effect of
 * an unrelated change — it fails CI instead of relying on a reviewer noticing.
 *
 * Same idiom as `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`, `runActionAllowlist.ts`, and
 * the RLS coverage allowlists.
 *
 * Adding an entry requires the same scrutiny the #3243 thread applied:
 * create/update only (org/site/key DELETION stays human + MFA on the main
 * API), a dedicated `:write` scope, per-principal write rate limiting, and
 * audit attribution to the service principal.
