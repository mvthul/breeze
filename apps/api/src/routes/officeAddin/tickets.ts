/**
 * Outlook tech add-in ticket creation (spec §3.2, Task 16).
 *
 * ONE message-id, ONE ticket — across BOTH channels. The add-in and the inbound
 * poller both claim the RFC 5322 Message-ID in `ticket_email_links`, whose
 * (partner_id, message_id) unique index is the only arbiter. Everything else in
 * this file exists to make the loser of that race leave no trace.
 *
 * TRANSACTION SHAPE (the load-bearing part):
 *   The whole handler already runs inside the tech middleware's
 *   `withDbAccessContext`, i.e. ONE open transaction. `claimMessageLink` uses
 *   `onConflictDoNothing`, so losing the race raises NO database error — the
 *   transaction is perfectly healthy and a plain try/catch could not undo the
 *   ticket we just inserted.
 *
 *   So the create+stamp+claim sequence runs inside a NESTED `db.transaction(...)`.
 *   Under drizzle's postgres-js driver a nested transaction is a SAVEPOINT
 *   (PostgresJsTransaction.transaction -> session.client.savepoint), so throwing
 *   `MessageClaimRaceError` out of that callback emits ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT,
 *   while the enclosing request transaction stays alive and usable.
 *   The statements inside the callback are issued through the ambient `db`
 *   proxy (which resolves to the OUTER transaction) rather than the savepoint's
 *   own `tx` handle — that is deliberate and correct: a savepoint is a
 *   connection-level marker, and both objects drive the same reserved
 *   connection, so everything between SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT is
 *   undone regardless of which handle issued it. Routing through the ambient
 *   proxy is also what keeps the RLS GUCs (set with SET LOCAL on the outer
 *   transaction) and every service's own `db` import working unchanged.
 *
 *   This correctness argument DEPENDS on the ambient context existing: with no
 *   outer transaction, `db.transaction(...)` opens a real top-level transaction
 *   while the callback's statements still route to the bare pool, so nothing
 *   would roll back. The route is only ever reachable through
 *   `officeAddinTechAuthMiddleware`, which always opens one.
 *
 *   After the rollback we re-read the winner's association with an ordinary
 *   scoped query — no `runOutsideDbContext` / system-context escalation is
 *   needed, because the request transaction was never aborted and the caller's
 *   partner-scope context still grants exactly the visibility we want.
 *
 *   WHAT THE SAVEPOINT DOES AND DOES NOT UNDO. It undoes exactly the writes
 *   issued on THIS connection inside the callback: the `tickets` row, its
 *   threading stamp, and the `ticket_email_links` claim attempt. It does NOT
 *   undo work that deliberately leaves this connection or this transaction:
 *     - `allocateInternalTicketNumber` runs under
 *       `runOutsideDbContext(withSystemDbAccessContext(...))`, i.e. its own
 *       short transaction on another connection. The loser therefore BURNS a
 *       per-partner counter value. That is by design (see the comment inside
 *       `allocateInternalTicketNumber` in ticketNumbers.ts —
 *       gaps in ticket numbers are acceptable, and holding the partner row lock
 *       inside the request transaction would be worse).
 *     - `emitTicketEvent` enqueues a BullMQ job for a ticket id that will not
 *       exist. Ticket-event consumers already MUST treat ticket-not-found as
 *       retryable rather than terminal (see the NOTE above `createTicket` in
 *       ticketService.ts), so the job retries and expires instead of
 *       corrupting anything.
 *     - `createAuditLogAsync` leaves an orphan `ticket.create` audit row.
 *     - `resolveConfirmedContact` (the `create_contact` requester branch) runs
 *       before the nested transaction opens, so the requester's `contacts`
 *       row survives a claim-race loser. Intentional: the technician
 *       explicitly confirmed that person, and they stay valid for the winning
 *       ticket / future ones. (#3258 — this used to be a `portal_users` row.)
 *   The first three are pre-existing consequences of the shapes those helpers
 *   chose; the route adds no new escape. The route's OWN audit event
 *   (`office_addin.ticket.created_from_email`) is written only after the nested
 *   transaction commits, so it never describes a ticket that vanished.
 *
 * Proven end-to-end against real Postgres in
 * `src/__tests__/integration/ticketEmailLinksClaim.integration.test.ts`
 * ("add-in create loses the race..."), which asserts the loser's ticket row is
 * absent afterwards.
