// mounted `metricsMiddleware` — so a live scrape carried `http_requests_in_flight`
// (seeded to 0 at boot) and no per-request series at all, and every panel and
// alert rule built on them matched nothing. `index.ts` now installs the
// middleware as the outermost global handler.
//
// Labels are `method` × `route` × `status_class`, all closed sets:
//   - `method` is normalised against the known HTTP verbs, else `other`.
//   - `route` is the HONO ROUTE TEMPLATE (`/api/devices/:id`), read from
//     `c.req.routePath` after the downstream handler has run, so it is drawn from
//     the registered route table rather than the request path. The previous
//     regex-scrubbing of the raw path only collapsed numeric and UUID segments —
//     any other path parameter (slugs, hostnames, agent versions) went into the
//     label verbatim and would have made this series unbounded the moment it was
//     wired up.
//   - `status_class` is the response class, not the exact code: six values
//     (`1xx`-`5xx` plus `other`) instead of ~40, and every consumer of these
//     metrics aggregates by class anyway. The cost is that 429s are no longer
//     distinguishable from 404s, so rate-limit volume is not observable here.
// The `org_id` label was dropped for the same reason — tenant count is unbounded.
// It never carried a real value in production anyway: nothing mounted the
// middleware, so the series did not exist at all.

 * books the two cases where Hono still returns a 500 to the client as a success:
 *
 *   1. a middleware that returns without responding and without `await next()` —
 *      the chain unwinds unfinalized and `hono-base` throws "Context is not
 *      finalized"; and
 *   2. `next()` rejecting with a NON-`Error` value, which `compose` rethrows
 *      instead of routing to `onError`.
 *
 * Booking those as 2xx is strictly worse than not measuring them: a heartbeat
 * handler failing this way would drive `agent_heartbeat_total{status="success"}`
 * at full fleet rate while every agent gets a 500 — a metric actively asserting
 * the fleet is healthy. `finalized` is the only honest signal, and reading it
 * first also avoids the getter's side effect of materialising a Response.
