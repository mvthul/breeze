/**
 * Static contract (#1105, BREEZE-H): every BullMQ enqueue call site in the
 * command_result pipeline runs under runOutsideDbContext. That pipeline
 * executes inside a held org-scoped transaction (runWithAgentDbAccess), so an
 * unwrapped enqueue pins a pooled Postgres connection idle-in-transaction
 * across Redis round-trips — and for instrumented queues fires the
 * assertOutsideHeldDbContext tripwire straight into Sentry. Seven sites were
 * fixed in one pass; this scan keeps the next one from regressing silently.
 *
 * #3097 split the pipeline across two files: the per-command-type handlers moved
 * to services/commandResultHandlers.ts so the HTTP transport could dispatch them
 * too, taking the discovery and SNMP enqueues with them. The contract is about
 * the pipeline, not the file, so the scan covers both — otherwise moving a call
 * site out of agentWs.ts would silently drop it from the guard, and the HTTP
 * path runs these same handlers inside the request-long org context, where an
 * unwrapped enqueue has exactly the same cost.

 * Direction is deliberate: ingress ⊆ queue. Ingress is the superset the agent
 * actually sends; the queue schema must accept everything ingress accepts. The
 * queue schema may declare EXTRA keys (server-added ones, e.g. `agentStatus`),
