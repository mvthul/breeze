/**
 * apps/api/src/worker.ts — `BREEZE_ROLE=worker` entrypoint (wave 3.5d-b, #4086).
 *
 * No static route imports. Almost every heavier dependency below — the DB
 * module, Redis, the migration-parity waiter, the extension loader, the
 * worker registry, the event-dispatch/event-bus modules, the AI-agent
 * enqueuer, the durable event-subscriber registry — is loaded via a dynamic
 * `await import(...)` inside `main()` rather than a static top-of-file
 * import. This isn't just style: several of those modules' own *static*
 * transitive closures used to reach into `routes/` several hops down —
 * `services/eventSubscribers.ts` → `jobs/automationWorker.ts` →
 * `services/automationRuntime.ts` → `services/scriptDispatch.ts` →
 * `routes/agentWs.ts`, and `extensions/builtinExtensions.ts` →
 * `extensions/stageExtension.ts` → `services/aiTools.ts` →
 * `services/aiToolsBackup.ts` → `services/commandQueue.ts` →
 * `routes/agentWs.ts`. Both are fixed now (the automation-worker subscriber's
 * handler lazily imports `automationWorker.ts` on first fire;
 * `stageExtension.ts` imports the reserved-tool-name check from the leaf
 * module `services/aiToolNames.ts` instead of the full `aiTools.ts` hub).
 *
 * The dynamic `await import(...)` boundary above is NOT by itself a
 * guarantee of a clean closure — a module loaded that way can still
 * statically drag in `routes/` once IT loads, exactly as the two chains
 * above did. The real, load-bearing guarantee is
 * `services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`'s SEEDED walk: it reads
 * this file's own `await import(...)` specifiers, resolves each to a file,
 * and walks every one of them statically, asserting the union reaches no
 * `routes/` file. One residue remains, explicitly allowlisted there with a
 * reviewer-facing justification rather than silently accepted:
 * `jobs/aiAgentEnqueuer.ts` → `services/aiAgents/runService.ts` →
 * `services/aiAgents/agentAuthContext.ts` → `middleware/auth.ts` →
 * `routes/auth/schemas.ts` — an inert schemas/env-flag module, not
 * socket-local dispatch; breaking it means extracting `ENABLE_2FA` out of
 * `middleware/auth.ts`, which needs its own reviewed change.
 *
 * `services/workerRegistry.ts` is deliberately EXCLUDED as a seed from that
 * walk — its own 104 `load()` thunks are lazy by design and must stay
 * unfollowed (see that file's header).
 *
 * Only genuinely leaf modules stay as static top-of-file imports:
 * `config/env` (`breezeRole` plus the readiness flag readers), `config/validate`,
 * `services/sentry`, `services/readiness` (type-only import of its own),
 * `services/shutdownPhases` (zero imports of its own), `utils/envInt` (zero
 * imports of its own), `services/rejectionSuppressions` (zero imports of its
 * own), `config/readinessConfig` (zero imports of its own) and
 * `services/workerReadinessRegistry` (only `import type { Worker }`) — each
 * independently verified importable without pulling in the route graph. The
 * consumer-readiness MANIFEST (`jobs/workerReadinessManifest`) is NOT static:
 * it value-imports `selectWorkers` from the worker registry, so it is loaded
 * in `main()`'s dynamic block alongside `./services/workerRegistry`.
 *
 * #4143 added four more, all held to the same bar: `services/eventLoopMonitor`
 * (`node:perf_hooks` only), `services/eventLoopStarvationReporter` (the
 * monitor only), `services/postgresConnectTimeout` (leaves only), and the two
 * metrics leaves `services/metricsRegistry` (`prom-client` only) and
 * `services/metricsScrapeAuth` (`node:crypto` only). `services/metricsRuntime`
 * and `db/dbPoolHealthMonitor` are deliberately NOT static — their graphs
 * reach `postgres`, and the health server must be listening before that loads.
 *
 * Boot order (the contract, see the plan doc's Task 6):
 *   1. dotenv + role guard (fail closed — this binary runs ONLY as worker).
 *   2. validateConfig(); initSentry().
 *   2b. #3022/#3214/#4143 observability: event-loop lag monitor +
 *      CONNECT_TIMEOUT classifier immediately after initSentry (so a stall is
 *      observable for the whole life of the process), and a `breeze_role`
 *      Sentry tag set inside initSentry so this container's events are
 *      distinguishable from the api container's.
 *   3. Slim raw-node:http health server, started FIRST (before DB/Redis). It
 *      serves `/health`, `/health/ready` and — auth-gated by the same rules as
 *      the api role's `/api/metrics/scrape` — `/metrics`.
 *   4. DB reachability probe, then `waitForMigrationParity()` — NEVER
 *      `autoMigrate()`. A worker-role process never applies migrations. Then
 *      `initializeDatabaseForStartup({ autoMigrateEnabled: false, production })`
 *      — with migrations disabled this runs ONLY `assertRequestDatabaseRoleSafe()`,
 *      the same production role check index.ts performs, so a worker-role
 *      process can never serve tenant-scoped queries through a SUPERUSER/
 *      BYPASSRLS pool.
 *   5. Redis mandatory — exit non-zero if unreachable (no limp mode).
 *   6. Extension runtime in `mode: 'worker'` (parity-check-never-apply,
 *      publish tenancy, stage, validate, seed state, activate registry; no
 *      web-asset registration — there is no HTTP server to serve it from).
 *   7. Register the AI-agent enqueuer + durable event subscribers.
 *   8. Start the registry's `global`-placement workers, then the
 *      event-dispatch consumer (its own phase-2 special, same as index.ts) —
 *      no relay consumer (socket-owner, stays on api/all).
 *   8b. Pool-health watchdog (after validateConfig and after the classifier —
 *      see the call site for both ordering constraints), plus the runtime
 *      metric series that publish its verdict and the event-loop lag.
 *   9. Signal handlers → phased shutdown. The preamble stops both monitors,
 *      then the phases run (drain → workers → queues → eventbus → redis → db →
 *      sentry), mirroring index.ts's Part A semantics.
