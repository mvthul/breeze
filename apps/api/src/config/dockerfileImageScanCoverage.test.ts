/**
 * Guard against the "the image we scan is not the image we ship" class
 * (issues #4273 / #4260).
 *
 * `security.yml`'s `Trivy Image Scan` job used to build and scan
 * `docker/Dockerfile.api` and `docker/Dockerfile.web` — two files that
 * `release.yml` never publishes (nor did the since-removed `hosted-images.yml`
 * manual-dispatch workflow, before it was replaced with an ad hoc
 * `docker buildx` + GHCR push from a maintainer machine). The images customers
 * actually run are built from `apps/api/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Dockerfile`,
 * and those were scanned nowhere. A green `Trivy Image Scan` therefore said
 * nothing about the two most widely deployed images in the product, which is
 * how they came to ship a known HIGH CVE (CVE-2026-14456, libcrypto3/libssl3)
 * that the *scanned* proxies had already been patched for (#4246 / #4257).
 *
 * The durable defect was the hand-maintained parallel list: a scan roster kept
 * by hand next to a publish roster kept by hand, with nothing tying the two
 * together. So this guard hand-lists neither. It derives:
 *
 *  - **published** — every `file:` input of every `docker/build-push-action`
 *    step, in every workflow, whose step actually pushes (`push: true`, or
 *    `outputs: ...push=true` for the push-by-digest lanes), with
 *    `${{ matrix.* }}` expanded against that job's own matrix.
 *  - **scanned** — the `dockerfile:` values of `security.yml`'s
 *    `trivy-image-scan` matrix.
 *
 * …and asserts published ⊆ scanned, modulo the one recorded exemption below.
 * Add a new published image and this test fails until it is scanned; retarget a
 * publish step at a different Dockerfile and it fails until the scan follows.
 *
 * Anything the derivation cannot resolve **throws** rather than resolving to
 * nothing. That asymmetry is deliberate: every assertion here is a set
 * comparison, so a derivation that silently shrinks turns the whole suite
 * vacuously green — the same "green means nothing" failure this file exists to
 * prevent, one level up.
 *
 * This is a static read of the workflow YAML; it never invokes Docker or the
 * GitHub API.
 *
 * ## What this guard does NOT prove
 *
 * Recorded so they are not mistaken for coverage:
 *
 *  1. **That the images are clean.** It proves the scan job *looks at* every
 *     published Dockerfile. Whether Trivy then finds something is CI's job.
 *  2. **That the scan job's result blocks a merge.** It does not, today:
 *     `main`'s ruleset requires exactly one status check, `CI Success`, whose
 *     `needs:` list contains no job from this workflow. So a red
 *     `Trivy Image Scan` is *visible* — on the PR, and on `main` — but not
 *     merge-blocking, before or after this change. (That visibility is what
 *     eventually surfaced CVE-2026-14456; see dockerfileOpensslUpgrade.test.ts.)
 *     `runs on pull requests and blocks on failure` below checks what is
 *     checkable from inside the repo — the trigger, the absence of a job-level
 *     `if:`, the absence of `continue-on-error` — but branch protection lives
 *     in repo settings, which no test here can read. Related: the matrix
 *     conversion renamed the check from `Trivy Image Scan` to
 *     `Trivy Image Scan (<image>)`. That is safe only because nothing requires
 *     the old context; if these are ever made required, they must be added as
 *     the eight new per-image contexts.
 *  3. **That the scanned build and the published build are the same bytes.**
 *     CI builds the Dockerfile at PR time; `release.yml` builds it again at tag
 *     time. Only the three M365 executors scan the exact published manifest
 *     before promoting its tag. The snapshot below records, per publishing job,
 *     whether it has a trivy-action step at all — a weaker fact than
 *     "scans the pushed digest", and labelled as the weaker fact deliberately
 *     (see the comment there). It keeps the gap visible; it does not measure it.
 *
 * Sources for the claims above that live outside this repo, so a later reader
 * knows they were checked rather than assumed: the ruleset in (2) was read with
 * `gh api repos/LanternOps/breeze/rulesets` on 2026-09-01 — one rule of type
 * `required_status_checks`, one context, `CI Success`. Re-check it before
 * relying on it; nothing here can.
