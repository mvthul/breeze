/**
 * Why this test exists
 * --------------------
 * Breeze runs Redis with `maxmemory-policy noeviction` on purpose: BullMQ job
 * hashes and the remote-WS lease records must never be evicted out from under a
 * running job. `services/remoteWsRedisTopology.ts` refuses remote admission
 * unless the live policy reads `noeviction`, and `scripts/prod/deploy.sh`
 * aborts a deploy that finds anything else — so the policy is a contract, not a
 * tuning knob.
 *
 * The docs drifted away from it anyway: `reference/troubleshooting.mdx` told
 * operators Redis "uses allkeys-lru eviction by default" (#6249, split out of
 * #6177), which is the opposite of what ships. An operator diagnosing a full
 * Redis would have concluded old keys were being reclaimed automatically, when
 * in reality writes were failing with OOM and the AOF replayed the same
 * over-cap dataset on every restart.
 *
 * This guard pins both halves: the compose files keep `noeviction`, and no
 * published doc claims Breeze's Redis evicts anything.
