/**
 * The credential-boundary executors (`m365-graph-read`, `m365-communications`)
 * used to reject EVERY `apk` invocation: "executor runtime must not resolve
 * mutable Alpine packages during the image build". That made the images fully
 * reproducible from their pinned base digest, but it also made CVE-2026-14456
 * unfixable in them, because the only available mitigation is an `apk upgrade`
 * (the upstream `node:24-alpine` tag still ships the vulnerable 3.5.7-r0, so
 * refreshing the digest fixes nothing — issue #4246).
 *
 * The owner-approved resolution narrows the rule instead of dropping it: exactly
 * one literal `apk upgrade --no-cache libcrypto3 libssl3` is permitted, and
 * every other apk invocation stays rejected. The accepted tradeoff is that these
 * two builds become time-dependent rather than fully reproducible, bounded to
 * those two named packages.
 *
 * The danger in a change like this is not the CVE — it is writing an allowance
 * so broad that the policy is silently gone while the check still "passes". So
 * this suite proves the narrowed rule REJECTS, not just that it accepts. It
 * drives the real shipped bash rule (`--check-apk`) against its own fixtures,
 * deliberately writing its own fixtures rather than reusing any case list
 * inside the script, so that editing the script cannot quietly reduce the
 * coverage here.
