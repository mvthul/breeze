 * The row is written by `setGrantBreezeMeta` before the consent route resumes
 * and the query also requires the Grant to be unrevoked and unexpired.
 *
 * Returns `null` only when the grant row itself does not exist (e.g. it was
 * cleaned up / never created — not a tenancy failure). Throws
 * `GrantTenancyError` when the row exists but its `partner_id` column is
 * NULL — that state means tenancy was never durably recorded, and callers
 * (token/refresh minting) MUST fail closed rather than treat it as "no
 * partner restriction" (the -02 bug: a null partner silently granted every
 * MCP scope after a restart cleared the process-local cache).

/**

 *   2. `requested` (the client's/grant's own scope set — callers passing no
 *      `displayed` set must pass an already-authoritative set here, not a
 *      raw untrusted request parameter);
 *   3. `displayed`, when provided (what the consent UI actually showed the
 *      user — never grant more than what was displayed); and
 *   4. the selected partner's current `mcp_allowed_scopes` policy.
 *
 * Fail-closed rules (design §Error Handling):
 *   - `partnerId === null` with `hasGrant === true` throws `GrantTenancyError`
 *     — an existing grant's tenancy must always be resolvable; "unknown"
 *     must never silently mean "all scopes".
 *   - `partnerId === null` with `hasGrant === false` is the documented
 *     legacy behavior for a grantless, client-only flow (e.g. the initial
 *     `/oauth/auth` resource-indicator check before any Grant exists) — no
 *     partner policy applies, so the result is simply the provider ∩
 *     requested ∩ displayed intersection.
 *   - A partner policy lookup failure (`getPartnerScopePolicy` rejecting)
 *     propagates to the caller rather than being swallowed into a scope
 *     fallback. (In practice `getPartnerScopePolicy` itself fails closed by
 *     returning `{ mcp_allowed_scopes: [] }` on a DB error rather than
 *     throwing — this function must not add a second, looser safety net on
 *     top of that by catching and reinterpreting a thrown error.)
