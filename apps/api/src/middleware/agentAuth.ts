 * gateway route, a nested sub-path) does NOT opt out. See the #1105 note at the wrap site. Auth still runs in
 * full for these routes — only the org-context transaction wrap is skipped.
 *
 * `commands` (the GET command poll) is here because its handler claims commands
 * inside its own `withSystemDbAccessContext` — the same claim+decrypt path the
 * self-managed heartbeat route already runs context-free. Keeping the
 * request-long org wrap on top made every poll hold TWO pooled connections at

 * parked idle-in-transaction waiting for an inner connection, reaped at the
 * 60s idle_in_transaction_session_timeout as `500 @60s`, re-polled by agents,
 * repeat (US prod outage, 2026-07-24).
 *
 * `eventlogs` (#6097) is here because its BullMQ log-forwarding enqueue was
 * discovered running inside the request-long wrap, pinning a pooled
 * connection idle-in-transaction across the Redis round trip on every
 * forwarded event-log submit — the exact #1105 shape. `runOutsideDbContext`
 * alone does not fix this (see the note at the wrap site below): only an
 * opted-out route avoids ever opening the outer transaction. The handler now
 * self-manages two short org-scoped contexts of its own (one for the
 * device/settings read, one for the insert + forwarding-config read), with
 * the rate-limit check and the forwarding enqueue running genuinely outside
 * any open transaction in between.
 *
 * `elevation-requests` (#6130) is here for the same reason one step earlier in
 * the handler: its per-device `rateLimiter` Redis round-trip ran inside the
 * request-long wrap, pinning a pooled connection idle-in-transaction on every
 * UAC observation an agent reports — and a UAC-prompt storm on one machine is
 * exactly the moment Redis is slowest. `runOutsideDbContext` cannot release
 * that outer transaction, so the route opts out and the handler opens ONE
 * org-scoped context of its own around all of its DB work, after the limiter
 * has decided (see routes/agents/elevationRequests.ts).

 * two sets are currently identical. They stay SEPARATE declarations because
 * they answer different questions and either may be re-widened independently;
 * the intersection below is what guarantees a re-widening can never hand an
 * action back to a drain kind that had taken it away.
 *
 * `routes/agents/token.ts` has no independent `devices.status` guard, and the
 * credentials it mints OUTLIVE the drain window — nothing revokes a staged or
 * promoted rotation when the deadline passes, and `POST /devices/:id/restore`
 * does not touch a single token hash. So a stolen agent token on a removed
 * device could be rotated into a fresh agent + watchdog + helper credential
 * set that lies dormant through the 403 after expiry and becomes the LIVE
 * credential the moment an operator restores the device — which this very
 * feature supports. Rotation also DEMOTES the legitimate token, so a thief can
 * deny the real machine the uninstall the window exists to deliver.
 *
 * Dropping it costs nothing. A staged-but-unconfirmed rotation still
 * authenticates as `role: 'agent'` through `matchRoleScopedAgentTokenHash`, so
 * an agent mid-rotation passes the Layer 1b role gate and can heartbeat and
 * collect its uninstall without ever calling `rotate-token`. #2774's
 * "don't strand a mid-stage rotation" rationale covers the CONFIRM half (the
 * machines there are legitimately alive and must stay manageable); it never
 * justified the MINT half for a machine we are actively uninstalling.
 *
 * `rotate-token/confirm` is NOT in this set because it never was in either set
 * — it is matched by its own two-segment branch below, and stays allowed for
 * both drain kinds so an agent that already persisted a staged credential can
 * finish and avoid being locked out mid-drain.
 *
 * #3997 — the same reasoning applied to the TENANT axis, which #3986 left
 * alone on scope discipline. Nothing revokes what the mint produced:
 * `abortOrganizationOffboarding` / `abortPartnerOffboarding`
 * (services/tenantOffboarding.ts) call `cancelDrainUninstallsForOrgIds` and
 * NOT `severAgentCredentialsForOrgIds` — that runs only on the finalize paths.
 * So a rotation performed inside the window leaves the tenant fully active
 * again, with the rotated agent + watchdog + helper credentials as the CURRENT
 * ones and the legitimate machine's token DEMOTED. A routine, attacker-
 * independent administrative action (start offboarding, then abort it) is
 * enough to promote a stolen token into a durable credential set.
 *
 * Dropping the mint costs the tenant axis nothing either. Nothing in agent
 * auth ever REQUIRES a rotation to keep authenticating: a current token has no
 * expiry in `matchAgentTokenHash`, and `isAgentTokenRotationDue` only sets the
 * advisory `x-token-rotation-required` response header — it never refuses a
 * request. A staged-but-unconfirmed rotation authenticates on the pending hash
 * and can still reach `rotate-token/confirm`. And the drain window is
 * OFFBOARDING_DRAIN_WINDOW_HOURS (72h by default), two orders of magnitude
 * under the 30-day rotation max age. There is no legitimate flow that must

  // passed, and the agent has to be able to reach us to collect it. Without
  // this window that command is undeliverable by construction (no heartbeat, no
  // command poll, no result post), which is the whole reason the window exists.
  //
  // Everything else about `decommissioned` is unchanged, and deliberately so:
  //   - `uninstallAgent:false` (no queued uninstall)  -> today's 403
  //   - deadline expired                              -> today's 403

  // The reason + deadline clauses live in `isDeviceUninstallDraining`; do not
  // re-derive or relax them here (see its module doc for the incident they
  // prevent).
  //
  // Layer 1b — ONLY the main-agent credential. The watchdog heartbeat branch
  // (routes/agents/heartbeat.ts) writes device state WITHOUT the terminal-status
  // guard the main branch has, and `self_uninstall` is `targetRole='agent'`
  // anyway, so a watchdog has nothing to collect here. Checked BEFORE the
  // predicate query so a watchdog credential costs no extra round trip.
  //
  // System DB context is REQUIRED, not decorative: the predicate joins `devices`,
  // which is RLS-scoped, and a contextless read defaults to scope 'none' — it
  // would return zero rows and silently report "not draining" for every device,
  // making the uninstall permanently undeliverable. No context is active here
  // (the request-long wrap is opened much further down), so this establishes
  // system scope rather than inheriting a narrower one.
  //
  // Runs before the rate limiters, exactly where the old unconditional throw
  // was, so a non-draining removed device sees byte-for-byte today's response.
