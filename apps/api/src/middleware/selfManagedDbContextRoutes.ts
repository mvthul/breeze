// #1448 — routes that opt OUT of the auto request-transaction.
//
// The auth middlewares (auth.ts, portal/auth.ts) normally wrap the entire
// route handler in `withDbAccessContext` → `baseDb.transaction`, pinning one
// pooled PG connection idle-in-transaction for the whole handler. That is fine
// for handlers that only do DB work, but a handler that makes a slow outbound
// HTTP call (e.g. Stripe Checkout `sessions.create`, a hundreds-of-ms round
// trip) inside that held transaction holds the connection idle across the
// network call — the #1105 pool-poison class.
//
// `runOutsideDbContext` alone does NOT help: it only swaps the AsyncLocalStorage
// `db` proxy reference (pool vs tx); the OUTER `baseDb.transaction` opened by the
// middleware is still held for the whole handler regardless. The only way to not
// hold the connection across the HTTP call is to never open the wrapping
// transaction for these routes — so the middleware consults this predicate and,
// when it matches, runs the handler with NO ambient context. Those handlers then
// manage their own short DB access contexts (read in a `withSystemDbAccessContext`,
// run the HTTP call truly outside any tx, write the result in a fresh short
// `withSystemDbAccessContext`), keeping the contextless-write guard (#1375) happy
// while never pinning a connection across the network call.
//
// Match against the full request path the middleware sees (`c.req.path`, which
// includes the `/api/v1` mount prefix and the substituted `:id`), so each entry
// is a regex over the concrete path, not a literal route pattern.
