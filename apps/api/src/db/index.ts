 * request, worker, agent and RLS context. This is the ONE explicit door, and it
 * is deliberately a narrow one:
 *
 * - **Read-onlyness is enforced by Postgres, not by middleware.** The
 *   transaction opens `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` as its first statement, so
 *   ANY write inside `fn` — through drizzle, raw SQL, a nested service call, a
 *   trigger-invoked function — fails with SQLSTATE `25006`
 *   (`read_only_sql_transaction`). App-layer 409s on archived orgs are additive
 *   UX; this is the boundary.
 * - **Deny-by-default is untouched.** The context grants exactly the org ids
 *   passed in and nothing else: no partner-axis access (`accessiblePartnerIds`
 *   stays null, so `breeze_has_partner_access` is false for every partner), no
 *   user-id self-read, no partner-wide catalog read branch. Cross-partner rows
 *   stay invisible because they are simply not in the id set. Callers MUST
 *   resolve those ids from the caller's own verified partner id — never from
 *   client input.
 * - **It refuses to nest.** `withDbAccessContext` early-returns when a context
 *   already exists, which is right for its purpose but would be a hole here:
 *   the ambient transaction is read-WRITE, so nesting would quietly run an
 *   "archived read" with none of the guarantees above. Wrap the call in
 *   `runOutsideDbContext()` when a request context is already open (that opens
 *   a second pooled connection while the first is held — keep `fn` short).
 *
 * Scope shape: `'partner'` with an explicit org allowlist, i.e. exactly the
 * shape `authMiddleware` builds for a partner-scope request, minus the partner
 * axis. That is deliberate — the RLS helpers only branch on `= 'system'`
 * (`breeze_has_org_access` is pure allowlist membership otherwise), so a bespoke
 * scope string would change nothing in Postgres while widening the
 * `DbAccessScope` union across every ambient-scope check in the codebase. The
