/**
 * #3996 — a tenant abort must not open a window in which the drain's queued
 * `self_uninstall` is collectable as an ORDINARY command.
 *
 * THE BUG. The drain narrowing is keyed on `organizations.status ===
 * 'offboarding'` (`getAgentTenantState`). The instant the abort's status write
 * is visible the tenant is no longer draining, so every agent under it
 * authenticates on the normal path — where `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` is
 * called with NO type allowlist and `self_uninstall` is exempt from every
 * claim-time eligibility cancel (`DRAIN_EXEMPT_TYPES`,
 * `commandClaimEligibility.ts`). A still-`pending` row is therefore an
 * ordinary claimable command, and the blast radius is the tenant's whole fleet.
 * On the #2879 suspended-lifecycle override path the window was genuinely
 * COMMITTED: the status UPDATE ran in its own short system transaction and the
 * cancel opened a second one afterwards.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY CLOSES IT, and why this is a real-Postgres test. Reordering
 * alone does not: while the abort transaction is open the last committed state
 * is still `offboarding` with pending rows, and an agent request proceeds
 * against that in its own transaction. The mechanism is the LOCK —
 * `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` selects candidates `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
 * so a row the abort has already locked is SKIPPED by a concurrent claim
 * rather than delivered. That is a property of Postgres row locking across two
 * connections; no mocked suite can assert it. The unit suite
 * (`services/tenantOffboarding.test.ts`) pins the ORDER of the statements;
 * this file pins that the order has the effect it is there for.
 *
 * HARNESS. The claim is issued from inside the `applyStatusChange` callback —
 * the exact moment the route's status write happens, with the abort's locks
 * held and nothing committed — and `runOutsideDbContext` puts it on its own
 * pool connection rather than joining the abort's transaction. It cannot
 * deadlock the test: `SKIP LOCKED` never waits.
 *
 * THE CONTROL IS LOAD-BEARING. "The claim returned nothing" is exactly what a
 * broken harness also reports (a device the claim path rejects for some
 * unrelated reason, a wrong `targetRole`, an unseeded row). The second case
 * stages the PRE-FIX shape — status flip committed first, cancel afterwards —
 * against an identically seeded tenant and asserts the claim DOES collect the
 * uninstall and flip it to `sent`. Both cases must hold for either to mean
 * anything, and the control is also the executable record of the defect.
 *
 * VERIFIED TO DISCRIMINATE, against this Postgres:
 *  - Control, before `ordinaryClaim` established a DB access context: red with
 *    `[]` — the claim's `devices` read was a contextless DENY, so the whole
 *    file would have passed vacuously. Fixed in the helper; see its comment.
 *  - `lockDrainUninstallsForOrgIds` DELETED from
 *    `abortOrganizationOffboardingAroundStatusChange` (reordering kept): the
 *    first case reds with `['self_uninstall']` claimed mid-abort. So the lock,
 *    not the order, is what closes the window — the property this file exists
 *    to pin.
