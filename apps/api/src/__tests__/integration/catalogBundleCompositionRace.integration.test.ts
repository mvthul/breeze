/**
 * #3816 — `setBundleComponents` validated bundle/component flags with UNLOCKED
 * reads, so a concurrent `updateCatalogItem` could convert a component into a
 * bundle after it had been observed as a plain item, producing a NESTED BUNDLE.
 *
 * The unlocked reads are the whole bug. An earlier draft of this header also
 * said the replace happened "outside a transaction" — that was FALSE and is
 * corrected here: on the REST path, the AI-tool path and in these tests, the old
 * delete and insert both ran inside the outer `withDbAccessContext`
 * transaction. The service-local transaction the fix adds is a SAVEPOINT there,
 * and its value is scoping the row locks, not adding atomicity.
 *
 * The fix locks, in one globally SORTED order, the deduplicated set of
 * {bundleId, ...componentIds} that THIS PARTNER OWNS, revalidates under those
 * locks, and does the replace in one transaction. Locking the ITEM rows rather
 * than the `catalog_bundle_components` edge rows is the load-bearing choice:
 * `updateCatalogItem`'s guard searches for the ABSENCE of an edge, and
 * `FOR UPDATE` cannot lock a row that does not exist yet. It works because the
 * component item must already exist (FK), so both writers contend on that row.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT OF THIS TEST — read before trusting it as proof. It is a
 * REGRESSION GUARD, not a reproduction of the original bug. It asserts the
 * invariant under real contention; it does NOT reliably fail against the
 * unfixed service.
 *
 * That was measured, not assumed. Three designs were tried against the
 * pre-fix code:
 *   - A single race asserting "no nested bundle afterwards": passed unfixed.
 *   - A holder client pre-locking the component row, asserting BOTH backends
 *     block: passed unfixed too. The INSERT's own foreign-key check takes a
 *     lock on that row, so the unfixed path blocks as well, just later — "both
 *     blocked" says nothing about whether validation happened under the lock.
 *   - Repeated unsynchronised trials: failed once on an early attempt, then
 *     passed 3/3 at 12 trials and 3/3 at 60. The scheduler here consistently
 *     favours one ordering, so repetition does not force the interleaving.
 *
 * Reproducing it deterministically needs barriers that pin the unfixed
 * sequence (validate unlocked -> conversion commits -> insert), which means a
 * test-only seam in the service. That was judged out of scope for a lock fix;
 * see the PR discussion.
