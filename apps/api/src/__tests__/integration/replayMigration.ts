/**
 * Replay a shipped migration file by path — as several integration suites do
 * today to prove idempotency of a trigger/guard/backfill migration — while
 * keeping the database in the same state a fresh `autoMigrate` run produces.
 *
 * THE TRAP this exists to close (#3205 W07 / PR #4838): `autoMigrate` applies
 * every migration file exactly once, in filename order, on a fresh database.
 * When migration A defines a SQL function and a LATER migration B redefines
 * it (`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`), a fresh database ends up with B's body.
 * A test suite that replays A alone, by path
 * (`readFile(new URL('../../../migrations/A.sql', import.meta.url))` +
 * `db.execute(sql.raw(...))`), reverts the function to A's body for the rest
 * of that vitest process — silently breaking any LATER suite in the same
 * shard whose assertions depend on B's behavior. That is exactly what
 * happened in CI shard 4 of PR #4838:
 * `pamDeviceMoveGuard.integration.test.ts` replays
 * `2026-09-17-pam-device-move-guard.sql` (which (re)defines
 * `breeze_device_child_orgid_tables()`) to prove that migration is a
 * privilege-grant no-op on re-apply. That wiped out the
 * `invoice_line_devices` exclusion added by the LATER
 * `2026-10-08-101300-device-move-exclude-billing-evidence.sql`, so
 * `billingEvidenceDeviceMove.integration.test.ts` — running afterward in the
 * same shard — saw the exclusion gone and 500'd on
 * `invoice_line_devices_line_org_fk` for the rest of the run.
 *
 * `replayMigration` closes this generically: after executing the named file,
 * it finds every function/procedure name that file (re)defines
 * (`extractDefinedFunctionNames`, `../../db/autoMigrate.ts`), then re-applies,
 * in filename order, every LATER shipped migration that also (re)defines any
 * of those names — bringing the database back to the state a fresh migrate
 * would leave it in.
 *
 * `-- @no-transaction` files (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and friends) are
 * refused outright: this helper's single `db.execute(sql.raw(...))` call
 * cannot run one (Postgres rejects `CONCURRENTLY` inside a transaction), and
 * no shipped migration currently combines that directive with a function
 * definition anyway — extend this helper deliberately if that ever changes.
