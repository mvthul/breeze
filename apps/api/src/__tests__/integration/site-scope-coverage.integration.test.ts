/**
 * Contract test: every per-device route under `apps/api/src/routes` must
 * apply a site-scope gate so that partner-scope users restricted to a
 * subset of sites within an org cannot read or mutate devices in other
 * sites. Site is an app-layer concept only — Postgres RLS does NOT defend
 * it — so any route handler that resolves `/:deviceId` from the URL without
 * checking `permissions.allowedSiteIds` is a cross-site escalation vector.
 *
 * The scanner ({@link findRoutesTouchingDevices}) walks every `.ts` file
 * under `routes/`, matches Hono route definitions whose URL pattern names
 * a device explicitly (`:deviceId` / `:deviceIds` / `:device_id`), and
 * checks that the handler body (or a file-local helper called from it)
 * references one of the canonical site-scope gates:
 *
 *   - `requireSiteAccess`             middleware (`middleware/auth.ts`)
 *   - `canAccessDeviceSite`           per-file helper convention
 *   - `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck`  canonical helper (`routes/devices/helpers.ts`)
 *   - `canAccessSite`                 underlying primitive (`services/permissions.ts`)
 *   - `authorizeRouteResilienceResources` shared recovery lineage gate
 *   - `resolveRouteAuthorizedDeviceIds` shared recovery list narrowing
 *
 * The allowlist below captures the set of routes that were known to be
 * missing the gate as of the SP2 sweep that added this test (PR #864/#868
 * fixed the bulk; this PR closes the audit-found cisHardening + software
 * inventory routes). New entries to the allowlist must include a comment
 * explaining why the site-scope check is intentionally absent or being
 * deferred — the default action on a new failure is to fix the handler,
 * not extend the allowlist.
 *
 * NOTE: the scanner is `:deviceId`-only — the contact routes
 * (`routes/orgContacts.ts`, #3258) carry no device in their path and are
 * covered by their own suites (`orgContacts.test.ts`, `contacts/crud.test.ts`,
 * `contacts/import.test.ts`, `contactImport.integration.test.ts`); do not
 * extend the scanner to reach them.
 *
 * NOTE: this test only catches per-device URL patterns. Handlers that take
 * a `deviceId` via query/body filter are still vulnerable to the same
 * class of bug; those are caught by route-level reviews and the targeted
 * tests under `__tests__/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts`. The list-style
 * software inventory route (`GET /software/inventory?deviceId=…`) was
 * also fixed in this PR via direct audit rather than via this scanner.
