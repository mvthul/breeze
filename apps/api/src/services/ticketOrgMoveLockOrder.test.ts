 * Cross-axis lock-order contract (#4657).
 *
 * `moveTicketOrg` (ticket axis) and `POST /devices/:id/move-org` (device axis)
 * both re-stamp `org_id` on the same ticket-linked child tables, and their row
 * sets genuinely overlap. Taking those locks in opposite orders is a live
 * AB-BA deadlock (40P01), which is what these assertions exist to prevent from
 * reappearing.
 *
 * This file only pins the two LISTS against the canonical order. The device
 * path's real statement sequence is pinned to `CUSTOM_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES` by
 * moveOrg.test.ts ('moves the device and writes audit on both orgs' asserts
 * `updatedTables` equals the spread of that array), and the ticket path
 * iterates `TICKET_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES` literally — so list agreement here
 * plus that behavior test covers both axes end to end.
 *
 * Both imports are deliberately light: `routes/devices/core.ts` and
 * `ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts` are pure data, so this suite runs in the unit
 * job with no database and no module mocking. That is the reason the ticket
 * list lives in its own module instead of inside ticketService.ts, which pulls
 * a live `db` pool at import time.

/**
 * Org-merge third-walker contract (#4748).
 *
 * `orgMerge.ts` computes its table walk from `topologicalCascadeOrder()`
 * (tenantCascade.ts) reversed. That function ties on alphabetical order for
 * tables with no FK between them, and the six tables above are exactly such
 * a set (see the FK note in ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts) — so left alone, the
 * merge visits them in reverse-alphabetical order, which disagrees with the
 * canonical lock order the two movers share. `fenceLoser()`'s app-layer fence
 * is the only thing keeping a merge and an in-flight move apart; a move that
 * starts before the fence lands can still contend under AB-BA ordering
 * (40P01).
 *
 * `applyTicketChildLockOrder` is the fix: given any walk order, it leaves
 * every other table's position untouched and permutes only the ticket child
 * tables' own slots into canonical relative order. These tests pin its
 * behavior directly (no DB needed — it's a pure array transform) and then
 * grep orgMerge.ts's source to prove both of its walk-order computations
 * actually call it, so a future edit that reintroduces a bare
 * `[...(await topologicalCascadeOrder())].reverse()` fails here rather than
 * only under Integration Tests.
