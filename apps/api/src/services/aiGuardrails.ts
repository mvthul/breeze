//      appear in both an *_ACTIONS table and the complementary whole-tool
//      set (manage_services, security_scan, s1_threat_action).
//   3. Input-aware overrides in resolveApprovalScope, for tool/action pairs
//      whose scope depends on ARGUMENT CONTENT, not just the tool/action
//      name — manage_organizations:update_org (status present vs a plain
//      rename) and s1_isolate_device (boolean `isolate`, not an `action`
