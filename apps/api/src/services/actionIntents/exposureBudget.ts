/**
 * Wave 6 PR 1 (#3828) — the pure, read-only twin of the two SELECT queries
 * `policyDecide.ts`'s `runAuthorizeTransaction` uses to gate a policy
 * decision. Extracted verbatim (same tables, same conditions, same order —
 * only the mutating advisory-lock/insert/CAS/outbox steps stay in
 * `policyDecide.ts`) so BOTH callers share one implementation of the
 * enforcement math instead of two copies that can drift:
 *
 *  - `policyDecide.ts` calls this from INSIDE its own system-scoped
 *    transaction (`inSystemDbContext`/`withSystemDbAccessContext`) — since
 *    `db` here is the same ambient, AsyncLocalStorage-backed accessor used
 *    everywhere else in this codebase (see `withDbAccessContext` /
 *    `withSystemDbAccessContext` in `db/index.ts`), calling this function
 *    from inside that transaction reuses the SAME live transaction — no
 *    explicit tx handle needs to be threaded through. Behavior is byte
 *    identical to the inline queries it replaces.
 *  - `GET /ai/agents/exposure-budget` (routes/aiAgents.ts) calls this
 *    read-only, under the caller's own request-scoped (RLS-enforced)
 *    context, with no `deviceId` — see that param's docstring below.
 *
 * DO NOT add a write here. The moment this needs to mutate anything, it has
 * stopped being safe to call from a plain read route.
