/**
 * Tool/action pairs that are TENANT-SHAPE MUTATIONS whose approved intent
 * names a target org distinct from the intent's own (source) org (#4650).
 * The tool's own handler (e.g. `aiToolsTicketing.ts`'s `move_org`) gates on
 * `auth.canAccessOrg(targetOrgId)`, but every release-time `AuthContext`
 * below is otherwise pinned to `accessibleOrgIds: [intent.orgId]` — so
 * without this allowlist that gate is unreachable for EVERY approved
 * cross-org move, not just unauthorized ones.
 *
 * Keyed `toolName -> action -> argument key holding the target org id`.
 * ONLY a tool/action pair listed here is eligible for the widening below;
 * every other tool/action keeps the single-org `accessibleOrgIds` it always
 * had. Adding an entry here is a deliberate widening of release-time trust —
 * pair it with the same three integration-test properties this fix
 * introduced: an approved release of the new tool/action succeeds
 * cross-org, no OTHER tool/action gets the widening, and an approver/agent
 * without access to the recorded target org is still refused.
 *
 * The widening below independently re-verifies the target org's CURRENT
 * partner against the releasing identity's own partner before granting
 * access — but that bounds WHO gets to widen, not what the tool is then
 * allowed to do with it. A new entry's TOOL HANDLER must independently
 * enforce its own tenancy boundary on the target (same-partner, or whatever
 * the mutation's actual constraint is) before executing — `move_org`'s own
 * `moveTicketOrg` (ticketService.ts) does this by re-fetching both orgs
 * under a row lock and rejecting a cross-partner move — never assume the
 * widening bound alone is a substitute for the tool's own check.

/**
 * API-key-owned intents (`requesting_api_key_id` set, `source: 'mcp_api'`).

 * `createActionIntent` (services/actionIntents/intentService.ts) always
 * attributes an intent to `auth.user.id` — every caller reaching it today
 * (the chat SDK) authenticates as a user — so `requesting_api_key_id` is
 * never actually set on a stored intent yet. The `mcp_api` MCP `tools/call`
 * → intent wiring that WOULD populate this field ships in Plan 2 (the MCP
 * cutover, spec §6.2), which also has to decide how an api-key-owned
 * intent's scopes/site restrictions get carried onto the released
 * AuthContext — mirroring middleware/apiKeyAuth.ts's apiKeyAuthMiddleware /
 * the `buildAuthFromApiKey` reconstruction in routes/mcpServer.ts. Rather
 * than fork a partial, untested copy of that (non-exported, ~90-line)
 * logic now, this checks the key is still live and then fails closed with a
 * clear signal — Plan 2 replaces this branch with the full rebuild.
