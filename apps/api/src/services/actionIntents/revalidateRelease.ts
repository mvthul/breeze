 * Shared release-time revalidation for an approved action intent (spec
 * docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-07-18-action-intents-approval-layer-design.md
 * §5 step 2). Extracted so the TWO release paths — the durable
 * `jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts` and the inline chat path in
 * `services/aiAgentSdk.ts` — run the IDENTICAL fail-closed checks. Previously
 * only the worker revalidated; the inline path executed the still-live chat
 * session's tool under the ORIGINAL `session.auth` the moment it won the
 * `approved -> executing` CAS, so a requester demoted, deactivated, or stripped
 * of org access during the approval wait still had their action executed if the
 * live session won the race against the worker.
 *
 * Returns the freshly-rebuilt actor `auth` on success. Callers decide how to
 * EXECUTE: the worker executes under this rebuilt context; the inline chat path
 * executes under its live `session.toolAuth` (which alone carries the
 * session-aware M365/Google connection context — and, for device-bound
 * sessions since #3087, is narrowed to the session/device org, whereas
 * `session.auth` stays the raw login context) — but only AFTER this returns
 * ok, i.e. only once the requester's CURRENT authorization has been
 * re-proven. The rebuilt `auth` and `session.toolAuth` describe the same
 * user + org (accessibleOrgIds === [intent.orgId] === session.orgId), so
 * they are interchangeable for tenant scope; the difference is only that
 * this one reflects live DB state.
 *
 * Every failure carries the same `errorCode` the worker has always CASed
 * `executing -> failed` with, so audit/metrics semantics are unchanged.
