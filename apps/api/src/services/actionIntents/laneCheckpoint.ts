/**
 * AI script authoring W04 (#5612), spec §4.6 invariant 11: the recovery
 * prerequisite is a RELEASE precondition, taken immediately before the
 * effect. Shared by the durable release worker and the inline chat release
 * so the two paths cannot disagree on when a rollback point exists.
 *
 * Placed after the digest recompute (so a drifted proposal never costs a
 * checkpoint) and before the dispatch (so nothing mutates the device without
 * a rollback point). A non-lane intent, or a lane intent whose evidence says
 * no checkpoint was required, returns `ok` without touching the device.
 *
 * Feasibility (a Windows device for checkpoint-needing classes) was proved
 * at creation by `evaluateScriptReviewerAutonomy`; this is where the
 * checkpoint is actually created.
