/**
 * Effect-digest pinning for tier-3 action intents (spec
 * docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-08-05-tier3-supervised-four-eyes-split-design.md
 * §4.1 / TOCTOU motivation).
 *
 * `argument_digest` (canonicalize.ts) proves the intent's INPUT hasn't changed
 * since approval. It says nothing about the TARGET the input references — an
 * approver can sign off on "run script <id>" and, minutes later inside the
 * approval or release window, someone edits that script's body. The
 * argument_digest is unchanged (the intent still says "run script <id>"), but
 * the approver approved content they never saw. `effect_digest` closes that
 * gap: it hashes the MATERIALIZED content the action will actually operate on
 * at creation time, and both release paths (jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts and
 * the inline chat release in services/aiAgentSdk.ts) recompute it immediately
 * before execution — a mismatch means the target drifted underneath the
 * approval and the release fails closed (`content_changed`), never executes.
 *
 * SCOPE-INDEPENDENT (changed 2026-08-06). Pinning used to be gated on
 * `approvalScope === 'four_eyes'`, which made the module's own flagship
 * resolver unreachable dead code: `run_script` is classified SUPERVISED
 * (aiGuardrails.ts's TIER3_SUPERVISED_TOOLS), so its resolver could never
 * run. The gap that gate left open is real — a supervised intent still has a
 * self-approval-to-execution window (RELEASE_LEASE_MS, ~10 minutes; 24h for
 * mcp_api), and a script body edited inside it would have executed with the
 * release none the wiser. The window is shorter for supervised than for
 * four_eyes, but it is not zero, and the cost of closing it is one indexed
 * read at intent creation. So: a digest is pinned whenever a resolver EXISTS,
 * regardless of approval scope. `intentService.ts` no longer branches on scope.
 *
 * Resolver map keyed by `tool` (e.g. `run_script`) or `tool:action` (e.g.
 * `manage_quotes:send`) for the multiplexer tools whose `args.action`
 * discriminates the operation. A tool/action pair with no entry has no
 * pinnable effect — computeEffectDigestOutcome returns `not_applicable` and
 * effect_digest stays NULL on the intent, which both release paths treat as
 * "nothing to check" (not a failure).
 *
 * Which four_eyes surfaces are allowed to have no resolver is itself a
 * contract: effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts requires every four_eyes
 * tool/action to either appear in EFFECT_DIGEST_RESOLVERS or be listed, with
 * a written reason, in that test's DELIBERATELY_UNPINNED allowlist.
 *
 * DESIGN CHOICE — three outcomes, not two. A resolver can fail to produce
 * material for two structurally different reasons, and the old `string | null`
 * return conflated them with the "no resolver at all" case:
 *
 *   - `not_applicable` — no resolver registered for this tool/action. Expected
 *     and correct; nothing was ever meant to be pinned.
 *   - `unresolved: 'missing_arg'` — a resolver exists but the id argument it
 *     needs is absent or not a string. The intent SHOULD have been pinned.
 *   - `unresolved: 'target_absent'` — a resolver ran but the referenced row
 *     doesn't exist or is soft-deleted (a deleted, or simply typoed, id). The
 *     intent SHOULD have been pinned.
 *
 * All three still store `effect_digest = NULL` — the stored-NULL semantics on
 * the release side are deliberately unchanged. What changed is that the two
 * `unresolved` cases are now OBSERVABLE: intentService.ts emits an
 * `effect_digest_unpinned` audit event carrying the reason, so a surface that
 * silently stopped being pinnable can be counted and alerted on instead of
 * vanishing into an indistinguishable NULL.
 *
 * Creation still only PINS content for later comparison; it does not validate
 * that the target exists — RBAC/existence validation is owned by the tool
 * handler at execution time (both at the inline approval path and, for the
 * durable path, inside executeTool itself). The one asymmetry this creates: if
 * the entity is created/becomes accessible AFTER intent creation but before
 * release, there is no digest to detect that (there was nothing to hash at
 * creation) — acceptable, since that path already goes through the tool
 * handler's own authorization at execution and was never the TOCTOU class this
 * feature targets (a target that existed and was approved, then mutated).

  // `content_changed` failure. Sorted because array order in jsonb is
  // storage-incidental, and a reorder is not a change of authority.
  //
  // A MISSING org row is pinned as `orgAgentId: null`, NOT reported as
  // TARGET_ABSENT: "this org has no row of its own and runs off the partner
  // baseline" is a real, reviewable state, and the grant's first act is to

  // ORG AXIS ONLY, one read, on the caller's own connection. The PARTNER
  // ceiling is deliberately NOT pinned: reading an `org_id IS NULL` row needs
  // `readWithPartnerAxisVisibility`, which opens a SECOND pooled connection
  // while the creation transaction still holds the first (the #1105 class this
  // module's header forbids), and it is invisible to an org-scoped creator
  // anyway — it would pin as "absent" at creation and as "present" at release,
  // failing every promotion. The ceiling is re-checked fail-closed at execution
  // under the graduation advisory lock, together with the feature flag, the
  // human origin and live eligibility (Task 15), so it is covered by a live
  // re-validation rather than by this pin.
  //
  // `args.orgId` is an ADDRESS, never an authority: it is set from the
  // authenticated org at creation, `createActionIntent` rejects
  // `args.orgId !== intent.orgId` (there BECAUSE both creation paths — the
  // promote route and the chat/MCP `tool()` declaration — funnel through it),
  // and the executor re-asserts the same equality UNCONDITIONALLY before
  // writing. It exists here only because a resolver receives `(args, database)`
  // and has no other way to name the org whose keys are being changed — both
  // release paths recompute inside `withSystemDbAccessContext`, which carries
  // no ambient org. The read predicates on org_id explicitly for the same
  // reason every loader in this codebase does: RLS passes unconditionally
  // under a system context.
  //
  // THIS PIN IS NOT A CROSS-TENANT CONTROL, and nothing may be built on the
  // idea that it is. It fails closed on a forged `orgId` only for an
  // ORG-scoped creator (creation reads no row → pins null; release reads the
  // real row → `content_changed`). A PARTNER-scoped caller passes
  // `breeze_has_org_access` for every org beneath the partner, so a forged
  // SIBLING org id reads that sibling's real row at creation and the SAME row
  // at release: the digest MATCHES and `content_changed` never fires. The

 * Resolves and hashes a tool call's materialized effect content, returning

 * is required, not imported ambiently: callers pass their own already-imported
 * `db` (../../db) singleton. `db`'s methods proxy through the request-scoped
 * AsyncLocalStorage context (see db/index.ts's withDbAccessContext), so
 * passing that SAME singleton reference is what makes "compute inside the
 * creation transaction" work — the digest read lands on whatever transaction
 * the caller currently has open, without this module needing to import
 * '../../db' (and its real Postgres client construction) itself. Tests just
 * pass a fake `database`.
 *
 * ONE NUANCE since #3409 PR4c-1 (Task 3b): run_script's snapshot loads the
 * tenant-variable scope through `loadTenantVariableScope`, and hands it THIS
 * SAME `database` as `opts.database` so the load rides the caller's connection
 * too. `loadTenantVariableScope`'s default path deliberately escapes to a
 * genuinely fresh system context (see tenantVariableResolution.ts for why
 * resolution must not depend on which of the five DISPATCH call sites is
 * ambient); taking that escape here would acquire a SECOND pooled connection
 * while the creation transaction still holds the first — the #1105
 * connection-hold class. Reusing the caller's connection is sound only because
 * every call site of this module is already system-scoped, which is the
 * caller obligation `opts.database` carries and `loadTenantVariableScope`
 * checks inside its `opts.database` branch — note that branch sits AFTER the
 * empty-`orgIds` short-circuit, so a script referencing no variables never
 * reaches the check (it issues no query either, so there is nothing to scope).
 *
 * The import graph therefore still reaches '../../db' transitively (through
 * tenantVariableResolution), and effectDigest.test.ts seams that ONE function.
 * The seam does not avoid LOADING the db module — `importOriginal()` loads it
 * — it avoids needing a live database and a real system-scoped context behind
 * it. Everything else still resolves purely against the injected `database`.
