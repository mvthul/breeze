/**
 * Action intents & durable approval layer — eligible-approver resolution
 * (spec docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-07-18-action-intents-approval-layer-design.md
 * §4; CRITICAL-2 fix).
 *
 * Given an org, returns the distinct set of user ids eligible to decide a
 * Tier-3 action intent: a user is eligible iff their role in (or covering)
 * the org grants `approvals:decide`.
 *
 * Mirrors `resolveElevationApprovers` (services/pamApprovers.ts) EXACTLY for
 * the role/membership resolution — role-ids granting the permission (incl.
 * wildcard '*' grants) via role_permissions ⋈ permissions, then
 * organization_users direct members + partner_users of the org's owning
 * partner with org_access 'all' or 'selected' ∋ orgId — but gates on
 * `PERMISSIONS.APPROVALS_DECIDE` instead of `DEVICES_EXECUTE`, and WITHOUT
 * the mobile-device narrowing: an action-intent approver decides from the web
 * app or an MCP client, not necessarily a phone, so `resolveElevationApprovers`'s
 * final `mobile_devices` filter has no equivalent here. One deliberate
 * divergence: both candidate queries here additionally join `users` and
 * require status='active' (`resolveElevationApprovers` does not) — a
 * disabled or still-invited account can hold a granting role but must never
 * be counted as an eligible approver, since that both inflates the
 * four-eyes fan-out and can wrongly suppress the sole-operator fallback.
 *
 * Runs under a system DB access context: this reads role_permissions,
 * permissions, organization_users, partner_users, and organizations — RLS-
 * scoped tables the caller's org-scoped request context (createActionIntent
 * runs inside the REQUESTER's org context, not a privileged one) cannot fully
 * see. Most importantly `partner_users` (Shape 3, partner-axis RLS), which a
 * pure org-scope caller can never read — exactly the population CRITICAL-2
 * exists to surface (partner-scope MSP techs/admins have no
 * `organization_users` row at all).

// Wave 3b — agent-intent eligibility (action-and-target, spec §3.4)
// ============================================================
//
// A SUPERVISED intent proposed by an ai_agent principal has no requester, so
// the "requester decides own intent" path can never apply. Eligibility is
// ACTION-AND-TARGET instead: the humans who could lawfully perform the action
// on the concrete target themselves — NOT `approvals:decide` holders
// (four_eyes keeps `resolveIntentApprovers` above, unchanged). The agent must
// never influence eligibility: `ai_agents.recipients` is notification-only
// and is deliberately never read here.

/**
 * Tools whose COMPLETE target set is expressed by their registered
 * `deviceArgs` (verified by hand against each handler). Anything not listed
 * is treated as having INDIRECT targets — deployments, groups, filters —
 * and only site-UNRESTRICTED humans are eligible for it.
 *
 * Hand-verification record (2026-08-23, remediate_vulnerability added #4452),
 * re-check the handler before adding an entry —
 * `intentApprovers.deviceTargets.contract.test.ts` only proves a listed tool
 * DECLARES deviceArgs, not that the declaration is complete:
 * - execute_command  (aiToolsScripts.ts): acts on the single required
 *   `deviceId`; nothing else in the input reaches another device.
 * - run_script       (aiToolsScripts.ts): iterates the required `deviceIds`
 *   array only (first 10); scriptId selects content, not targets.
 * - manage_services  (aiToolsScripts.ts): single required `deviceId`;
 *   serviceName is a name on that device, not a target.
 * - remediate_vulnerability (aiToolsVulnerability.ts): `deviceId` is
 *   OPTIONAL, unlike the three above — the handler enforces it as a
 *   COMPLETE pin only when the caller supplies it (every finding cited by
 *   `deviceVulnerabilityIds` must belong to that one device, or the whole
 *   call is refused with `finding_device_mismatch`); when omitted, findings
 *   may legitimately span multiple devices ("interactive chat may still
 *   omit it and remediate across devices as before", aiToolSchemas.ts). The
 *   sweep pipeline that scopes this tool's intents always supplies it
 *   (sweepFindings.ts's `proposalToolInput`), so the resolver below only
 *   trusts the tool's own `deviceId` when it is actually PRESENT in args —
 *   never the resolved intent/run device as a lone stand-in — so an
 *   unscoped, unpinned call still falls closed to `indirect` instead of
 *   under-representing the true device set.

 * remediate_vulnerability, must not have its target manufactured solely from
 * `target.deviceId` when the arg is omitted — see the union site below).
 *
 * P2-2 (#4189): that third argument used to be the run row itself. It is now
 * the resolved target — `effectiveTargetDeviceId(resolveIntentTargetDevice(
 * intent, run))` (intentTargetScope.ts) — so a scoped intent's approvers are
 * the humans who can reach the SCOPED device, and a device-less sweep run
 * never drags a `null` in where a real device exists. Callers MUST pass the
 * resolved value; passing `run` directly is the bug this parameter was
 * renamed to make visible.
 *
 * Every other tool — and any call where no device id can be resolved at all —
 * is `{kind:'indirect'}`, which fails closed to site-unrestricted approvers
 * (review blocker 1: deviceArgs explicitly does not cover indirect or
 * list-returning targets, and e.g. manage_deployments accepts
 * targetType all/group/filter with no site check in its handler).
 *
 * Throws on an unknown device id: a proposal citing a nonexistent device must
 * not be fanned out. The device read is pinned to `orgId` (the intent's org),
 * so a cross-tenant device id is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one and
 * hits the same throw — tool args are LLM/runner-produced, and silently
 * accepting a foreign device's site into the scope would both violate the
 * fail-closed fan-out contract and act as a cross-tenant device-UUID
 * existence oracle (review finding 1).
