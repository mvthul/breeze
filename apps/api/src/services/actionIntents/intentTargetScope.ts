/**
 * P2-2 (Task A3, #4189) — the ONE resolver every run-derived reader of an
 * action intent's target device goes through.
 *
 * Before P2-2 an agent-originated intent's target device was, everywhere,
 * `ai_agent_runs.device_id`: creation re-verified the guardrail with it, the
 * approver fan-out unioned it into the target scope, and all four
 * release/decide-time readers (actorContext, agentReleaseAuthority,
 * policyDecide, isAgentIntentDecideAuthorized) re-derived it from the run
 * row. That is exactly wrong for a scheduled SWEEP: the sweep run is
 * DEVICE-LESS (one run walks a whole fleet) and must still be able to mint an
 * intent bound to ONE device — and `checkAgentGuardrails` denies every
 * mutating call whose `policy.deviceId` is null (aiGuardrails.ts: "the run is
 * not device-bound"), so a device-less run could not propose anything at all.
 *
 * `action_intents.scope_kind` / `scope_device_id` (Task A1) carry that
 * explicit binding. This module is the single place that decides which device
 * an intent actually targets, so no reader can drift back to the run's own
 * device once a scope exists:
 *
 *   - no scope  -> `{ kind: 'run', deviceId: run.deviceId }` — byte-identical
 *     behavior to before this module existed, including a null device.
 *   - scope set -> `{ kind: 'scope', deviceId }` — the run's device is never
 *     consulted, even when the run has one.
 *   - scope declared but `scope_device_id` NULL -> `{ kind: 'tombstone' }`,
 *     the fail-closed state. The column tombstones (non-null -> NULL, the ONLY
 *     transition the immutability trigger permits) on a device DELETE via the
 *     FK's `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and on a device moveOrg via that
 *     transaction's explicit detach — see db/schema/actionIntents.ts's
 *     comment block on the two columns.
 *
 * Deliberately PURE — no DB, no imports from `intentService` (which imports
 * the approver/target machinery that would cycle back here). Callers that need
 * the device's CURRENT org/site do the read themselves; the release-time
 * contract they must implement is:
 *
 *   a tombstone, a scoped device that no longer exists, OR a scoped device
 *   whose CURRENT `org_id` differs from the intent's org are ALL treated
 *   identically — `agent_scope_lost`, intent -> failed / decide -> false.
 *
 * The org half of that is the backstop for a device org-move that lands
 * through the DB-side cascade rather than the HTTP moveOrg route (which does
 * detach the scope): the row would still carry a live `scope_device_id`
 * pointing at a device that now belongs to someone else.

 *   - a tool carrying NEITHER device argument passes. `remediate_vulnerability`
 *     is the motivating case: its targets are `deviceVulnerabilityIds`, whose
 *     per-finding device assertion is a DB read and therefore Task 5's job,
 *     not this pure function's.
 *
 * Fail-closed on shape: a present-but-non-string `deviceId`, or a `deviceIds`
 * that is not an array of exactly the scope device, throws rather than being
 * waved through as "malformed, so harmless". Null/undefined values count as
 * absent (the tool schema, not this gate, decides whether that is legal).
 *
 * BOUNDARY — read this before assuming a scoped intent cannot name another
 * device. This gate knows exactly TWO argument names, `deviceId` and
 * `deviceIds`. A tool whose device argument is named anything else PASSES it
 * unexamined, including every tool whose targets are indirect (a group, a
 * filter, a saved deployment) or expressed through an id that only RESOLVES
 * to a device via a DB read. The registry's own per-tool `deviceArgs`
 * declaration (`services/aiTools*.ts`, consumed by
 * `intentApprovers.DEVICE_COMPLETE_TARGET_TOOLS`) is the authority on which
 * argument names a given tool actually targets devices through, and it is
 * deliberately NOT consulted here: this function is pure and synchronous,
 * while a complete check for those tools needs I/O.
 *
 * Tool-specific containment is therefore a per-tool obligation layered on top
 * of this one, not a substitute for it. `remediate_vulnerability` is the
 * worked example and the pattern to copy: it carries only
 * `deviceVulnerabilityIds`, so it passes this gate, and its per-finding
 * "every cited finding belongs to the scope device" assertion — which must
 * read the findings to know — ships in Task 5.
