/**
 * Cross-signal corroboration.
 *
 * Several detectors deliberately cap their score below `severity.alert_score`
 * because, on their own, they describe behaviour a legitimate operator also
 * exhibits — trialling remote sessions on a new device, paying with a spouse's
 * card, running unrenamed provider VMs. The config comments on those caps
 * (`rmm.session_intensity.max_score`, `billing.cardholder_name_mismatch.score`,
 * `rmm.provider_default_hostname.generic_max_score`) all say the signal "needs
 * a second signal to reach alert".
 *
 * That second half was never built. Severity is a pure function of one signal's
 * own score, so a partner firing four capped `watch` signals produced four
 * `watch` rows and — because only `alert` is ever delivered
 * (persistence.ts) — zero notifications. In production that gap cost real
 * victims: on several confirmed-fraud accounts a capped `watch` signal was the
 * ONLY signal that fired and nobody was notified.
 *
 * This closes it by emitting a synthetic `fraud.corroborated_watch` signal
 * rather than by mutating another detector's severity in place. Keeping it a
 * separate row means each detector keeps its own honest score, the existing
 * dedup/stale-resolution key `(partner_id, signal_key)` still works, and an
 * operator can acknowledge "yes, this combination is fine for this partner"
 * without suppressing the underlying detectors.

/**
 * Which independent line of evidence a signal represents.
 *
 * Corroboration counts DISTINCT AXES, never raw signal count, and that
 * distinction is the whole false-positive control. `rmm.enrollment_ip_spread`
 * and `rmm.device_ip_scatter` are both restatements of one observation — this
 * fleet's addresses are scattered — and they co-fire on legitimate MSPs that
 * serve residential customers. Counting them as two would manufacture an alert
 * out of a single fact. They share an axis on purpose.
 *
 * A signal key absent from this map is treated as its own axis. That is the
 * safe default for a NEW detector (it can corroborate immediately), but it
 * means adding a detector that restates an existing observation REQUIRES adding
 * it here — otherwise it double-counts. `corroboration.test.ts` asserts every
 * key in its hand-maintained EMITTED_KEYS list is mapped or explicitly
 * ineligible — when you add a detector, add its key THERE as well as here, or
 * the assertion cannot see it.
