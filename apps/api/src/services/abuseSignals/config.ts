  // which makes the same argument about DESKTOP-/LAPTOP- consumer defaults.
  //
  // Two tiers, because they carry very different confidence:
  //
  //  - CURATED: the hostname starts with a prefix listed in
  //    ABUSE_HOSTNAME_INDICATORS. That list is a specific, human-reviewed
  //    attribution ("this VPS provider's default prefix has only ever appeared
  //    on abusive fleets"), so curated_score is set to meet severity.alert_score
  //    exactly: at default thresholds a single matching device reaches alert.
  //    Both numbers are independently overridable via ABUSE_SIGNAL_OVERRIDES,
  //    so that equality is an intent, not an invariant — lowering
  //    curated_score or raising severity.alert_score demotes the tier. The list
  //    is deliberately EMPTY in this public repo — publishing it would tell the
  //    operator exactly which string to rename. Same reasoning and same
  //    mechanism as ABUSE_SCRIPT_INDICATORS.
  //
  //  - GENERIC: the hostname merely has the SHAPE of a stock OS installer
  //    default (see PROVIDER_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME_PATTERNS). It needs no
  //    configuration, but an unconfigurable pattern list has to be narrow: a
  //    small shop really does name machines `PC-0042`, so the built-in list is
  //    restricted to installer-generated artifacts and, on its own, this tier
  //    is corroboration — it requires a meaningful share of the fleet and caps
  //    below severity.alert_score. Same rule as session_intensity and
  //    cardholder_name_mismatch — do not raise past the alert threshold
  //    without a discriminator that actually exists.
  //
  // Neither tier is age-decayed: a fleet of unrenamed provider VMs is evidence
  // about what the fleet IS, not about how recently the account was created.
