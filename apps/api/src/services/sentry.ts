 * behind it — into the module graph of everything that merely reports an error,
 * including the DB module itself. That measurably slowed module evaluation and
 * pushed `db/requestDatabasePool.test.ts` (a hard 15s budget on a dynamic
 * `import('./index')`) over its timeout. Inverting the dependency keeps
 * `services/sentry` a leaf, matching how the metrics recorders are wired
 * (`setBackupMetricsRecorder`, `setS1MetricsRecorder`, …).

  // hardcoded worker-name literals passed to attachWorkerObservability; no
  // tenant, device or host identifier.
  //
  // Chronology matters here, because it explains a two-day-old regression rather
  // than an original defect. `3c92c07cd` (2026-07-25, #2786) added the
  // processFn patch that put `worker` on the per-job scope, and it WORKED:
  // `git show a50769487^:apps/api/src/services/sentry.ts` has no tag filtering
  // at all. Two days later `a50769487` (2026-07-27, #2843, security wave 7)
  // introduced this allowlist and silently dropped `worker` on the way out. So
  // the BREEZE-9 fix was live for two days and has been inert since — the
  // hardening regressed it, and nothing failed to say so.
  //
  // The diagnosis in jobs/workerObservability.ts is therefore correct but
  // incomplete, not wrong: the `failed` listener genuinely does fire outside job
  // execution, which is why the processFn patch was needed. This allowlist gap
  // is a second, later defect stacked on top of it.

  // per-job counter — unbounded by construction, exactly the high-cardinality
  // tag the captureMessage doc comment warns against.

  // touch this file. Inert until that lands — an allowlist entry only ever

  // distinguishable only by bundle line number, which changes every build.
  // `patch_reconcile_repeat` is a BUCKETED streak length (1 | 2-4 | 5-9 | 10+),

/**
 * #3077: the same rebuild for TRANSACTION events, which `beforeSend` never sees.
 *
 * `@sentry/core` dispatches the two hooks by event type — `beforeSend` for error
 * events, `beforeSendTransaction` for transactions — so `scrubEvent` above ran on
 * exactly half the outbound traffic. Meanwhile `requestDataIntegration()` is a
 * default node integration whose `processEvent` fires on EVERY event type and
 * copies the request header bag verbatim into `event.request.headers`; the SDK's
 * own `SENSITIVE_KEY_SNIPPETS` deny list (which would have caught `x-api-key`)
 * is only applied on the span-attribute path, not to the event body. So a
 * sampled transaction on an api-key route shipped a live `brz_` credential with
 * no error involved at all — and `.env.example` ships
 * `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1`, so sampling is on for anyone who copies it.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT reuse `scrubEvent`: that one deletes `contexts`,
 * and a transaction event without `contexts.trace` is invalid — reusing it would
 * silently disable tracing rather than secure it. Instead `contexts` is narrowed
 * to `trace` alone, which is the field the event format requires and the only one
 * carrying no host or tenant detail (`nodeContextIntegration` fills the rest with
 * server metadata).
 *
 * `event.spans[].data` is left alone: those attributes already pass through the
 * SDK's `filterKeyValueData` + `SENSITIVE_KEY_SNIPPETS` in
 * `httpHeadersToSpanAttributes`, so header values arrive pre-redacted there.

 * on the three things that outlive this change:
 *   - the required field sits adjacent to `message` and is self-labelling at
 *     the call site, instead of being an unlabelled literal in slot 2 or 5;
 *   - the four optional fields stop being order-dependent — a dozen call sites
 *     previously padded `undefined` into `extra` purely to reach `tags`;
 *   - the next optional knob (a `fingerprint`, a sampling hint) is added
 *     without touching a single existing caller.
 * `captureException` keeps its positional shape deliberately: it has no
 * required discriminator, and churning it would buy nothing.
 *
 * `tags` is the ONLY channel that reaches Sentry from here. Anything you want to
 * GROUP BY must be a bounded, allowlisted tag: `scrubEvent` deletes `message`,
 * `logentry` and `extra` from every outbound event, so a discriminator that is
 * not an allowlisted tag does not exist as far as triage is concerned. Console
 * output is the place for unbounded detail.
 *
 * Keep tag values low-cardinality (a handler name, not an id) — high-cardinality
 * tags inflate Sentry's index without making anything more triageable.
