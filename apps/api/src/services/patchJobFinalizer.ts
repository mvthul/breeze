/**
 * The ONE writer of a per-device patch outcome (#5128 §F.2, W3).
 *
 * Before this module a patch device could only finish one way: the per-device
 * BullMQ task polled `device_commands` for up to 30 minutes and then wrote the
 * rows itself (`recordDeviceExecution`). Offline devices never got that far —
 * they were recorded `skipped` and the job finished green.
 *
 * With the offline queue an `install_patches` command can now finish LONG after
 * its BullMQ task has exited, through four different doors:
 *
 *   - the agent's result, days later, via `commandResultHandlers`;
 *   - delivery expiry / execution timeout, via the stale-command reaper;
 *   - a cancel (user, org move, decommission, claim-time ineligibility);
 *   - supersession by the next scheduled occurrence of the same policy.
 *
 * Every one of those has to write the same `patch_job_results` rows and move the
 * same `patch_jobs` counters, so they all come through here. The synchronous
 * path (`recordDeviceExecution`) is just the `kind: 'result'` caller that
 * happens to already know the job context.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY IS THE POINT, AT TWO LEVELS. The rows for `(jobId, deviceId)` are
 * the key: the finalizer applies only while at least one of them is
 * non-terminal (or there are none yet, the synchronous first-write case). That
 * read is not enough on its own, because two doors on two processes can both
 * see the same non-terminal rows before either commits — so the per-row UPDATE
 * is compare-and-swapped on the row still being non-terminal, and the
 * `patch_jobs` counter moves ONLY when that CAS actually wrote a row. A second
 * arrival returns `{ applied: false }` and touches no counter. Never move a
 * `patch_jobs` counter outside this module.
