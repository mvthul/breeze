// command to the agent then decrypts just-in-time via `decryptCommandForDelivery`
// — WS dispatch (commandQueue), the heartbeat responses, the command-list poll,
// and the WS pending-command fetch (agentWs) — and EVERY terminal writer strips

//      in place under a global-constant AAD. Used by encryption_rotate_key.
//   2. ENVELOPE (`ENVELOPE_COMMAND_TYPES`, #3409 PR4) — the whole `secretEnv`
//      map sealed into one `secretEnvEnvelope` string under an AAD bound to the
//      specific command id and device id. Requires a SecretPayloadContext, and
//      throws without one rather than passing plaintext through.
