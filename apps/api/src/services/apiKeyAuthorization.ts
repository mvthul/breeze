/**
 * SR2-15 live authorization for HUMAN-delegated API keys.
 *
 * A human key's authority is DELEGATED from its creating user and must never
 * outlive that user's authority. On every request we re-resolve the creator's
 * CURRENT permissions and:
 *   1. DENY if the creator has no live membership/role on the key's tenant
 *      (getUserPermissions returns null when neither the org nor the partner
 *      axis yields a role row) — the off-boarding/membership gate, reported as
 *      `no_membership`. A contextless/errored read also denies, but as
 *      `lookup_error`: it proves nothing about the creator (see the reason
 *      union below).
 *   2. RE-CLAMP the key's stored scopes against those live permissions; a scope
 *      the creator no longer holds DENIES (a permission reduction after mint
 *      cannot be out-run by a key minted while the creator was more powerful).
 *
 * We resolve LIVE rather than trusting a mint-time snapshot or an epoch: the
 * design requires catching out-of-band membership/role SQL changes that call no
 * app service, and getUserPermissions is already Redis-version-cached and
 * invalidated by every in-app membership/role mutation, so this is cheap and
 * always correct. See the PR 5 plan Q1.
 *
 * Axis (Q5): BOTH orgId and the org's owning partnerId are offered so a
 * Partner-Admin creator (who has NO organization_users row for the key's org,
 * only a partner_users row) still resolves.

 * site-restricted in this PR (they are org-scoped only).
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED: the DB read is wrapped in try/catch and a null/missing row is
 * treated identically to an errored read — both DENY. A contextless or
 * 0-row read that resolves to "authorize" would be a fail-OPEN and must
 * never exist here.
 *
 * `service_principals` is a FORCE-RLS org-scoped (shape-1) table. This
 * function runs in the pre-request auth path (apiKeyAuth middleware /
 * mcpServer's buildAuthFromApiKey), before the request's own RLS context is
 * established, so the read must go through `withSystemDbAccessContext` —
 * mirroring the PR1 creator-status read in `apiKeyAuth.ts` and
