/**
 * #6353 — the device-independent `network_check` alert sweep.
 *
 * A `network_check` monitor compiles to ONE managed `network_monitors` row that
 * `monitorWorker` probes once per running org and writes back to
 * `network_monitor_results`. Its verdict is therefore the ORG's, not any
 * device's, and the per-device alert sweep (`jobs/alertWorker.ts`
 * `evaluate-device`) is the wrong shape for it twice over: it visits every
 * ONLINE device the policy reaches (N alerts for N devices), and it never
 * visits an offline one (no alert at all when the check's alert device is
 * down).
 *
 * This sweep runs once per org per `evaluate-all` tick instead:
 *   1. every active managed check that runs for the org — its own rows plus
 *      its partner's partner-wide rows (`org_id NULL`), fanned out by the
 *      DEVICE org's partner exactly as `monitorWorker.selectDueMonitorJobs`
 *      fans the probe itself;
 *   2. ONE alert device per check, chosen by the legacy network worker's rule
 *      constrained to the monitor's policy attachment
 *      (`resolveNetworkCheckAlertDeviceForMonitor`; offline devices eligible);
 *   3. one `evaluateNetworkCheckAlertsForDevice` pass per distinct alert
 *      device, which runs the ordinary monitor pipeline (resolution through
 *      the device's configuration policies, episode seam, cooldown, dedupe)
 *      for just those checks;
 *   4. any open episode a check still holds on a device that is no longer its
 *      alert device is closed as `monitor_detached`, so the alert device can
 *      move (a newer device enrolls) without a stranded episode.
 *
 * Runs under the same system DB context the alert worker already uses for
 * `evaluate-device`; nothing here escalates further.
