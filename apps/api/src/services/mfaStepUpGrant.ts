/**
 * Existing-factor step-up grants for sensitive MFA mutations on an
 * ALREADY-PROTECTED account, registering an authenticator device as an
 * approver, and the other purpose-bound operations listed below.
 *
 * Minted by FOUR sources: (1) `POST /auth/mfa/step-up`, after the caller
 * proves an existing factor (TOTP/SMS/passkey); (2)
 * `POST /authenticator/register-grant`, the password-proof fallback for
 * accounts with no stronger factor; (3) `mintLoginRegisterGrant`
 * (`routes/auth/helpers.ts`), a best-effort login-time mint for mobile
 * clients only; (4) the SSO re-auth callback (`GET /sso/callback`, reauth
 * mode), the passwordless equivalent of (2) — see #4018.
 *
 * Grants from (1) are presented back to a factor-addition endpoint
 * (`/mfa/enable`, setup-confirm, `/mfa/sms/enable`, `/passkeys/register/*`) or
 * recovery-code rotation as `stepUpGrantId`. Grants for approver-device
 * registration are presented as `registerGrantId` to
 * `POST /authenticator/devices/webauthn/options`,
 * `POST /authenticator/devices/webauthn/verify`, or the mobile
 * `POST /authenticator/devices`.
 *
 * Bound to the live `authEpoch`/`mfaEpoch` + the initiating session's `sid` so
 * a factor change (which bumps `mfa_epoch` + revokes refresh families) or a
 * session switch invalidates any outstanding grant. Single-use via Redis
 * `getdel` at the terminal write; non-consuming `validateStepUpGrant` exists
 * for the intermediate `webauthn/options` step (the SAME grant is consumed
 * later at `webauthn/verify`).
