/**
 * urlSafety — shared helper for SSRF-safe outbound HTTP.
 *
 * Threat model: a URL supplied by a tenant (OIDC issuer, webhook target) must
 * not resolve to an internal network address. A naive "lookup + fetch" pattern
 * has a TOCTOU window where DNS rebinding can swap a public IP for a private
 * one between validation and connection.
 *
 * `safeFetch()` closes that window: it resolves the hostname ONCE, filters out
 * private/loopback/link-local addresses, and dials the request with a custom
 * `lookup` function that always returns the validated IP. The hostname is
 * preserved as SNI. `safeFetch` derives the `Host` header from the URL and
 * ignores caller-supplied Host values so tenant-controlled headers cannot
 * redirect virtual-host routing. Certificate chain validation is NEVER disabled.

/**
 * `safeFetch`, plus an EXPLICIT, bounded redirect chain.
 *
 * `safeFetch` deliberately follows nothing: it hands back the 3xx so the caller
 * decides whether the `Location` is worth trusting. That default must not
 * change — every existing caller relies on it — but some server-configured
 * endpoints simply cannot be reached without following, GitHub release assets
 * being the motivating case (`github.com/.../releases/download/...` 302s to
 * `objects.githubusercontent.com`). Converting such a caller to bare `safeFetch`
 * turns a working download into `download failed with status 302`.
 *
 * The security property that matters: each hop is a fresh `safeFetch`, so every
 * intermediate URL is independently DNS-resolved, filtered and IP-pinned. A
 * redirect to `169.254.169.254`, loopback or RFC1918 is rejected exactly as a
 * first-party URL would be — which is the whole reason naive
 * `redirect: 'follow'` is an SSRF bypass and this loop is not.
 *
 * Method/credential handling follows the fetch spec's intent: a 303 (and a
 * 301/302 on a non-GET/HEAD request) degrades to GET with no body, and
 * credential headers are dropped when the hop crosses to a different origin.
