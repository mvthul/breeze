  // Supervised self-decide (Task 6): skip the WHOLE assertion/assurance ladder
  // — no WebAuthn challenge, no partner-policy step-up floor, no
  // ReauthRequiredError ceremony — but ONLY when both of the following hold.
  //
  //  1. The partner's authenticator policy is not actively ENFORCING (fix
  //     round 1, finding 5 — adjudicated requirement). An enforcing partner's
  //     step-up floor must not be silently bypassed just because an intent
  //     classified as supervised: the requester can still satisfy it with a
  //     WebAuthn L3 proof, exactly like the four_eyes sole-operator
  //     self-approve does.
  //  2. NO proof was presented (fix round 2, finding 1). `skipAssuranceLadder`
  //     used to ignore `proof` entirely, so a mobile approver device that
  //     signed the decision in its Secure Enclave had that signature silently
  //     DISCARDED: never verified, anti-clone signature counter never bumped,
  //     challenge left unconsumed, and the audit row recorded L1 /
  //     'session_tap' / device_id NULL. Worse, a FORGED or REPLAYED proof was
  //     ignored rather than rejected, so the approve succeeded at L1 instead
  //     of 401ing — contradicting this handler's own "a presented-but-invalid
  //     proof throws → 401 (never silently L1)" invariant and the mobile
  //     client's contract. An optional proof therefore always goes through the
  //     real ladder; the sole-operator gate below is what keeps it from
  //     turning into a NEW blocking requirement.
  //
  // Only checked for an approve (deny is never blocked by assurance, so
  // there's no reason to spend a partner-policy read on it) —
  // `resolveApprovalAssurance` is the same synchronous "no proof presented"
  // L1/session_tap default `proof===undefined` resolves to today; reusing it
  // (rather than hand-rolling the literal) keeps the recorded factor
  // byte-for-byte identical to that existing no-proof shape and impossible to
  // drift from `assertDecisionConsistent`'s invariants.
  //
  // P2-2 batch decide: `preverifiedAssurance` short-circuits this ENTIRE block
  // (proof verification, partner-policy floor, sole-operator step-up) because
  // the batch already ran it ONCE against `batchAssertionKey(...)` — the
  // single-use WebAuthn challenge / mobile nonce cannot be consumed again per
