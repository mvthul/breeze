/**
 * The `approval_decide` "recent ceremony" grant (#5601) — the approvals-domain
 * half of the credential whose transport lives in `services/mfaStepUpGrant.ts`.
 *
 * WHY: approving several Tier-3 AI chat tool calls in a row cost one full
 * passkey ceremony per approval row (three in 20 seconds, observed on US prod
 * 2026-09-11). #5600 removes the ceremony for SUPERVISED rows under a
 * NON-ENFORCING partner, at the cost of recording them L1/session_tap. This
 * covers the one remaining supervised case: rows under an ENFORCING partner
 * policy, whose step-up floor must not be bypassed but should not be
 * re-prompted per row either.
 *
 * SUPERVISED ONLY (Todd, 2026-09-11). four_eyes is the high-trust path —
 * irreversible, money-moving, tenant-crossing and control-handover actions —
 * and keeps its per-approval passkey. A four_eyes row never mints a grant and
 * never redeems one; presenting a grant there is refused (403
 * step_up_required) so the client falls back to a real ceremony. That
 * confines the one accepted cost of this credential — a live stolen access
 * token plus a leaked grant id can repeat a decide inside the window — to
 * supervised rows, which under a non-enforcing partner #5600 already lets
 * through with no ceremony at all.
 *
 * The house position rejects a bare wall-clock grace window
 * (plans/security-auth/2026-09-02-mobile-platform-attestation-l4.md: "A dated
 * grace window is rejected outright"). This is not one: it is a credential,
 * minted only by a real ceremony, bound to identity/session/factor-epochs and
 * a resource digest, stored server-side, and recorded distinctly in audit.
 *
 * Full design + the Codex advisor review that reshaped it:
 * docs/superpowers/specs/security-auth/2026-09-11-approval-decide-step-up-grant.md

 *     the high-trust path and must pay a fresh passkey per approval; the
 *     decide core refuses a presented grant on such a row BEFORE reaching this
 *     module too, so this is the second of two independent gates.
 *
 *  1. `critical` is excluded outright. L4 means "the human proved themselves
 *     again, JUST NOW, for this one" — a platform-bound key plus a fresh
 *     account re-authentication at the decide surface. A reusable credential
 *     is incompatible with that claim, and asserting L4 from a 4-minute-old
 *     grant would be exactly the audit dishonesty this design forbids. (The
 *     tier is also in the digest, so a `high` grant cannot match a `critical`
 *     row either — belt and braces.)
 *
 *  2. A row with NEITHER conversation identifier is refused. Without this the
 *     digest would have a catch-all "neither" bucket that every intent in an
 *     org would share, and the conversation binding — the single most
 *     important component of the scope — would be decorative for exactly the
 *     flow it exists to bound. This is the Codex advisor review's blocking
 *     finding: web AI chat calls `createActionIntent(session.auth, ...)` with
 *     the HUMAN's auth (aiAgentSdk.ts), so `requesting_agent_run_id` is null
 *     there and `agentRunId` alone would have bounded nothing.

/**
 * Canonical digest for an `approval_decide` grant.

 * Canonicalization is part of the security contract, not a convenience: mint
 * and redeem must produce byte-identical input for the same scope, so this is
 * the ONE function both call. Keys are emitted in fixed alphabetical order
 * because JSON.stringify preserves insertion order, which would otherwise let
 * two equivalent scopes hash differently — same reasoning as
 * `maintenanceResourceDigest`.
 *
 * Each component removes a distinct escalation:
 *  - approvalScope: belt-and-braces for the supervised-only rule. Eligibility
 *    already refuses anything else at both mint and redeem; pinning it in the
 *    digest as well means a grant could not cross scopes even if that check
 *    were ever loosened.
 *  - agentRunId + aiSessionId: the operator's attention is scoped to ONE
 *    conversation, so the credential must be too. Without it, a ceremony for
 *    a chat being actively watched would cover a Tier-3 request raised four
 *    minutes later by a different conversation — including a background run
 *    nobody looked at.
 *  - orgId: the tenancy boundary. A technician approving for Org A must never
 *    have that ceremony silently cover Org B's Tier-3 action.
 *  - riskTier: the severity boundary. `requiredAssurance` is a function of the
 *    tier, so pinning it makes achieved-vs-required an identity rather than an
 *    inequality that could drift.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included: the approval id and the argument digest. Either
 * would make the grant single-row by construction and defeat the feature. The
 * per-row `boundArgumentDigest` check in the decide core keeps CONTENT binding
 * intact; this grant binds AUTHORITY TO DECIDE, not what was decided.
