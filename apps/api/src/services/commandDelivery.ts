 * Decrypt a batch of JUST-CLAIMED commands for delivery, releasing any that

 *
 * `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` flips rows to `sent` before the payloads are
 * decrypted. `decryptCommandsForDelivery` then silently drops any command whose
 * sensitive payload can't be decrypted (rotated/corrupted APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
 * AAD mismatch) — without a release, such a command strands as `sent` with zero
 * delivery attempts until the stale reaper misattributes it to an agent
 * timeout. This helper diffs input vs output by id and releases every dropped
 * command so the failure stays recoverable (and, once the command ages out
 * while `pending`, the reaper reports "agent never received the command"
 * rather than "no response from agent"). The decrypt failure itself is
 * reported to Sentry by `decryptCommandForDelivery`; this only adds a capture
 * when the RELEASE fails, since that re-strands the command.
 *
 * Successfully decrypted siblings in the same batch are always returned — one
 * bad payload never sinks the batch (and a release failure never throws out of
 * the delivery path).
 *
 * #3409 PR4c-2 — the secret-delivery claim gate runs FIRST, before anything is
 * decrypted: a `script` command carrying a sealed `secretEnvEnvelope` must
 * never be opened for an agent that cannot export the env var, because that
 * agent would run the script with the credential silently unset. The gate
 * withholds such a command from the batch — driving it TERMINAL (`failed`,
 * payload erased) when the device row actually reports an unsupported
 * version, or leaving it `sent` for the stale reaper when the device row
 * could not be read at all (that refusal has to stay reversible; see
 * scriptSecretDelivery.ts). Either way, and unlike the #2414 decrypt-failure
 * path below, a withheld command is deliberately NOT released back to
 * `pending` — an incapable agent would immediately re-claim it. Withheld ids
 * therefore never reach the release loop, which only ever sees the gate's
 * survivors.
 *
 * The gate throws only on a caller contract violation (a single agent's
 * reported capability handed to a multi-device batch); that must surface, not
 * be swallowed into a delivery.
 *
 * The gate needs the DB (a capability read plus terminal writes), so this
 * function must be called inside a DB access context — the heartbeat's
 * ambient org context on the heartbeat paths, an explicit system context on
 * the self-managed-context REST poll (routes/agents/commands.ts).
 *
 * `opts.reportedScriptSecretEnvVersion` lets a caller that just received the
 * agent's own capability report (the heartbeat) hand it to the gate as
 * authoritative, avoiding both the extra select and the race against the
 * heartbeat's own non-sticky device write.
