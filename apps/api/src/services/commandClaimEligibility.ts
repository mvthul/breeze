 * transaction, so a row this function cancels can never be delivered by a

 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL — this does NOT serialise against a concurrent org move. The
 * claim reads `devices` without `FOR UPDATE` (deliberately: taking a row-
 * exclusive lock on the device on every heartbeat would serialise the hottest
 * path in the product against every other write to that row). So a move that
 * commits between this read and the claim's status flip can leave one command
 * delivered just after the device changed org — the move's own pending-row
 * sweep then misses it because the row is already `sent`. Closing this needs
 * the claim to lock `devices` before `device_commands` (matching org-move's
 * order, since the reverse would deadlock); deferred rather than risking
 * heartbeat contention here. The window is a few milliseconds and the blast
 * radius is one command inside the same partner.
 *
 * `held` rows are left `pending` and untouched; `cancelled` rows are terminal
 * with their payload erased.
 *
 * NOT re-checked in v1 (OD-4, deferred to W6 behind #3985): full rehydration of
 * the requester's current org/site/action permissions, and script edit/delete
 * (the payload is an immutable snapshot — editing a script must never
