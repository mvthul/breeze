/**
 * #2877 — run entry/abort DB work on the CALLER's transaction when that
 * transaction can SEE the target tenant row; otherwise open a fresh system
 * context.
 *
 * The org/partner status routes call the begin/abort functions AFTER `UPDATE ...
 * RETURNING` on the very organizations/partners row, inside the request
 * transaction the auth middleware wraps around the whole handler. The old
 * shape here — `runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(fn))` —
 * unconditionally opened a SECOND pooled connection and UPDATEd the SAME
 * row, which then waited forever on the request transaction's row lock while
 * the request could not commit until this function returned: a
 * cross-connection cycle Postgres's deadlock detector cannot see (each side
 * looks merely blocked / idle-in-transaction). Killing the wedged request
 * tore the entry — the status write rolled back while the fresh connection's
 * side effects committed.
 *
 * Reusing the ambient transaction removes the second connection (no lock to
 * wait on) AND makes the transition atomic: status + drain stamp + queued/
 * cancelled uninstalls commit or roll back together, so the torn state is
 * unreachable.
 *
 * The visibility gate is what makes the ambient path RLS-correct: the work
 * only reuses the caller's transaction when that context's allowlists (the
 * exact inputs to breeze_has_org_access / breeze_has_partner_access) grant
 * the target row, so the stamp UPDATE, the devices FOR UPDATE, and the
 * device_commands writes (unscoped anyway) all resolve the same rows a
 * system context would. When the ambient context CANNOT see the row —
 * #2879's suspended-lifecycle override is the live case: the suspended org
 * is excluded from accessibleOrgIds, so the route ran its status UPDATE on
 * its own short system transaction — running here under the caller's scope
 * would silently 0-row the stamp and queue nothing. The fallback to a fresh
 * system context is deadlock-safe precisely BECAUSE of the invisibility: an
 * ambient transaction that cannot see the row cannot have UPDATEd it, so it
 * holds no lock for the fresh connection to wait on. (On that path the entry
 * is two transactions; a crash between them leaves status-without-stamp,
 * which repairIncompleteEntry already backstops.)
 *
 * Callers with NO ambient context (e.g. a bare job entrypoint) keep the
 * fresh system context, exactly as before. Note the drain reaper DOES run
 * inside a system ambient context — it never calls the begin/abort
 * functions, but a future background caller that does would take the ambient
 * branch (scope 'system' always passes the gate), which is the desired
 * behavior there too: its own transaction, no second connection.
 *
 * Cost, accepted deliberately: on the ambient path the request transaction
 * now holds the queueDrainUninstalls device FOR UPDATE locks (and performs
 * the abort path's Redis cache invalidation) until the handler commits. The
 * remaining handler work after these calls is only a fire-and-forget audit
 * write and response serialization, and offboarding transitions are rare
 * admin operations — a short, bounded hold, vs. the alternative of a
 * permanent deadlock (#1105 tripwire still watches the duration).

 * Release tenant offboarding's hold on in-flight drain uninstalls for the

 * and shared by the transition handlers when an operator forces
 * suspended/churned mid-drain.
 *
 * A row can now be CO-OWNED (a device individually removed while its tenant
 * is ALSO offboarding — `deviceUninstallDrain.ts`'s `queueDeviceUninstall`
 * merges into the same row rather than inserting a second one). Strip ONLY
 * our own `tenant_offboarding` reason via `array_remove` — mirroring
 * `deviceUninstallDrain.ts`'s `releaseDeviceRemoveReason`, the sibling
 * function this is intentionally shaped after — and cancel a row only once
 * NO reason remains. A `device_remove`-owned row therefore survives a tenant
 * abort with its reason AND its deadline intact (this function never touches
 * `device_remove_expires_at`).
 *
 * NULL-compatibility decision: `uninstall_reasons IS NULL` rows are treated
 * as tenant-offboarding-owned here (and in `countOutstandingUninstalls`
 * below), same predicate in both places. Every row this feature queued
 * before the multi-owner reason column existed is NULL, and at production
 * scale tenant offboarding is the only feature that ever queued self_uninstall
 * rows in bulk before this change — so treating NULL as "not ours" would make
 * every currently in-flight offboarding's outstanding count silently drop to
 * zero and finalize immediately with a false "clean drain" report, reviving
 * the exact false-confidence bug (#2774: 78/80 uninstalls lost) this whole
 * drain-report mechanism exists to prevent. `array_remove(NULL, x)` is NULL
 * in Postgres, so a NULL row is simply left NULL by the strip below and then
 * cancelled outright by the `(reasons ?? []).length === 0` check — correct,
 * because a NULL-reason row can never be co-owned by `device_remove` (that
 * queuer always stamps a non-null array on every row it touches), so there is
 * no other owner's claim to preserve.
 *
 * Accepted tradeoff: `abuse.ts`'s bulk suspension insert also stamps no
 * reason by design (module doc, `deviceUninstallDrain.ts`), so if a partner
 * is abuse-suspended while one of its orgs is independently offboarding AND
 * that org's offboarding is then aborted, this would also cancel the
 * abuse-queued row. That requires two independent, rare events to coincide
 * on the same org; treating NULL as unowned instead would guarantee the
 * worse, common-case bug above for every in-flight legacy drain. Not
 * resolved here — flagged for whoever eventually backfills real reasons.

/**
 * #3996 — take the drain's own rows under lock BEFORE the caller flips the
 * tenant status away from `offboarding`, and cancel them in the SAME
 * transaction as that flip.
 *
 * The bug this closes: the drain narrowing is keyed on
 * `organizations.status === 'offboarding'` (`getAgentTenantState`), so the
 * moment the status write is visible the tenant is no longer draining and
 * every agent under it authenticates on the ORDINARY path, where
 * `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` is called with no type allowlist. A still
 * `pending` `self_uninstall` is then an ordinary claimable command — and the
 * blast radius is the tenant's whole fleet, not one endpoint. On the #2879
 * suspended-lifecycle override path that window was genuinely COMMITTED: the
 * status UPDATE ran in its own short system transaction and the cancel ran in
 * a second one afterwards. This is the org/partner-scale sibling of the
 * device-level bug fixed in #3986.
 *
 * Why locking, not just reordering. Atomicity alone does not close it (see
 * the #3996 thread): while the abort transaction is open the last COMMITTED
 * state is still `offboarding` + pending rows, so an agent request proceeds
 * against that in its own transaction and claims the row. What does serialize
 * the two is the lock: `claimPendingCommandsForDevice` selects candidates
 * `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (`commandDispatch.ts`), so a row this function has
 * already locked is SKIPPED by a concurrent claim rather than delivered, for
 * the whole remainder of the transaction. Taking the lock before the status
 * write therefore leaves no window — committed or in-flight — in which the
 * tenant reads as non-draining while its uninstalls are still claimable.
 *
 * Lock ORDER is deliberate and must not be reshuffled: tenant row first, then
 * the command rows, matching entry (`beginOrganizationOffboarding` →
 * `queueDrainUninstalls`, which UPDATEs `organizations` then locks `devices`
 * before inserting). Locking the commands first would invert the order
 * against a concurrent entry and make an abort/entry pair deadlockable.
 *
 * The cancel runs only if `applyStatusChange` reports the write landed
 * (non-`undefined`). A 0-row status write means the caller lost a race — most
 * sharply into the lifecycle-frozen set, where an `archived`/`merging` tenant
 * may have a legitimately live archive drain — and cancelling that tenant's
 * uninstalls would be wrong. The pure `FOR UPDATE` select mutates nothing, so
 * the miss path leaves no trace beyond releasing its locks at commit.
 *
 * Cost: the lock select waits on any in-flight agent claim transaction for
 * the same row (short-lived — a heartbeat handler). Waiting is the point: the
 * abort then cancels a row that is `sent` rather than racing its delivery.
 * The residual is an uninstall already on the wire, which the API cannot
 * recall at all — that is #3995's agent-side pre-teardown fence, not this.

 * (same compatibility predicate as `countOutstandingUninstalls` and
 * `cancelDrainUninstallsForOrgIds` above: `array_remove(NULL, x)` is NULL in
 * Postgres, so a NULL row is simply left NULL by the strip below and then
 * correctly identified as "no owner left").
 *
 * Fix round 1: this used to cancel and report EVERY pending/sent
 * self_uninstall for the org, the same bug already fixed on the abort path
 * (`cancelDrainUninstallsForOrgIds`) but left live here. Concretely: an org
 * offboards, one of its devices is separately Removed (queuing a
 * `device_remove`-owned row with its own 72h deadline), the offboarding
 * force-finalizes at ITS deadline — and the device-remove row got cancelled
 * before its own window closed, plus counted in the never-drained report as
 * though it were the tenant's to account for. The user's explicit Remove was
 * silently undone, exactly as an unfixed abort would have done.
 *
 * Same shape as `cancelDrainUninstallsForOrgIds`: strip ONLY the tenant
 * reason via `array_remove`, cancel a row only once no reason remains. A
 * `device_remove`-owned, tenant-UNOWNED row (only `device_remove` present)
 * never matches the WHERE below at all (excluded by `tenantOwned`), so it
 * survives finalize with its reason AND `device_remove_expires_at` untouched
 * — this function never writes that column. A CO-owned row (both reasons)
 * loses only the tenant reason and stays live, non-terminal, for the
 * device-remove owner.
 *
 * The never-drained report (`neverDelivered`/`deliveredUnconfirmed`) is
 * built from the SAME tenant-owned candidate set, before the strip/cancel —
 * a device_remove-only row was never tenant offboarding's to report on, and
 * a co-owned row surviving the strip is still correctly reported as "this
 * tenant's own drain did not confirm it," even though the row itself lives
 * on for its other owner.
 *
 * Fix round 2: the terminal counts (`uninstallsCompleted`/`uninstallsFailed`)
 * are ALSO scoped to `tenantOwned` now — they used to count any
 * completed/failed self_uninstall on a device in the org, with no reason
 * filter, inflating the permanent audit record with work this drain never
 * owned (e.g. an abuse-suspension's unrelated, unmerged NULL-reason insert
 * completing during the same window). See the comment at that query.
 *
 * The strip/cancel step below re-scopes by `id IN (...)` against the exact
 * ids this same tenant-owned select already captured, rather than
 * re-deriving the org/device scope — mirrors the id-list pattern
 * `cancelDrainUninstallsForOrgIds` uses for its own cancel step, and
 * sidesteps drizzle's single-`.where()`-per-statement limitation
 * (an UPDATE can't independently AND a devices join here without a second
