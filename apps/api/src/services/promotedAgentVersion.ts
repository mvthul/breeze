/**
 * Which release the public component-download routes should actually serve.
 *
 * Issue #3499: the bytes and the checksum used to come from two independent
 * sources of truth. `GET /agent-versions/latest` reads the checksum from the
 * `agent_versions` row with `isLatest=true`; `GET /agents/download/:os/:arch`
 * built its GitHub redirect from `BINARY_VERSION || BREEZE_VERSION` resolved
 * from per-process env at request time. Those two can disagree — and did, one
 * full release apart, when the GitHub sync stalled and left `agent_versions`
 * frozen at 0.104.0 while the download route happily served 0.105.1. install.sh
 * then fetched a 0.104.0 checksum, downloaded 0.105.1 bytes, and aborted with
 * "Checksum verification failed for downloaded agent binary".
 *
 * The checksum check was not malfunctioning — it correctly refused a binary
 * that did not match the metadata it was handed. The defect is that the two
 * halves could disagree at all. This resolver is the single query both halves
 * now go through, so a stale sync yields a *consistent old version* instead of
 * an inconsistent pair.
 *
 * MUST STAY IN LOCKSTEP with two other readers of the promoted row:
 *   - `GET /agent-versions/latest` (routes/agentVersions.ts) — serves the
 *     checksum these bytes are verified against. Same five predicates and the
 *     same `ORDER BY created_at DESC` tiebreak: if one orders and the other
 *     does not, a duplicate `isLatest` row makes them select DIFFERENT rows
 *     and reintroduces #3499 with no signal at all.
 *   - `resolvePinnedUpgradeTarget({ pin: null })` (routes/agents/helpers.ts)
 *     — picks the version the heartbeat OFFERS the fleet. If it and this
 *     resolver disagree, agents are told to upgrade to a version whose bytes
 *     this server will not serve.
 *
 * `agent_versions` is a global (non-tenant) table with no RLS, so this is safe
 * to call from the public, unauthenticated download routes in any DB context —
 * the same reason `GET /agent-versions/latest` queries it with the bare `db`
 * handle.
