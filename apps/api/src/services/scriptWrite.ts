/**
 * Resolve the `{ orgId, partnerId }` a CLONE of `source` should land under
 * (#4887). Delegates every actual tenancy/capability decision to
 * `resolveScriptCreateScope` — this function only decides WHICH availability
 * to ask it for, based on how the clone request relates to its source, so a
 * clone can never silently change tenancy shape:
 *
 * - A system-library script (`is_system`, `org_id` AND `partner_id` both
 *   NULL) is always duplicated into a specific org — the same rule
 *   `POST /import/:id` already applies, the other system-script duplication
 *   path. A caller who omits `orgId` here gets the same "which org?"
 *   resolution `POST /import/:id` and plain create use (own org for an
 *   org-scope caller, the single accessible org for a partner-scope caller
 *   with only one, else a 400). System scope MUST name an org explicitly —
 *   `resolveScriptCreateScope`'s system branch has no "which org" fallback of
 *   its own and would otherwise resolve to `org_id: null, partner_id: null`,
 *   an ownerless row invisible under RLS to everyone who isn't system scope.
 * - Organization scope ALWAYS lands the clone in the caller's own org,
 *   regardless of the source's scope (mirrors `resolveScriptCreateScope`'s
 *   own org branch, which likewise ignores `availability`/`requestedOrgId`).
 *   This is not a "downgrade" of a capability the caller ever held: org
 *   scope can never create OR maintain a partner-wide script through any
 *   path in this system (`canManagePartnerWidePolicies` is unconditionally
 *   false for it), so there is no other org-scoped-writable destination to
 *   land in even when the source (readable to them per `canReadScript`,
 *   which also lets org-scope callers read their own partner's partner-wide
 *   rows — see the scripts.ts list route) happens to be partner-wide.
 * - An explicit `requestedOrgId` on a non-system source (partner/system
 *   scope) is always an intentional target: a genuine cross-org copy, or a
 *   deliberate narrowing of a partner-wide script into one org. Checked with
 *   the same org-access rule as create; this is narrowing, not widening, so
 *   it never requires the partner-wide capability.
 * - No `requestedOrgId` on a non-system source (partner/system scope): the
 *   clone preserves the SOURCE's scope rather than picking a new one. An
 *   org-owned source clones into that same org. A partner-wide source
 *   (`org_id` NULL, `partner_id` set) stays partner-wide by default — which
 *   still runs through `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` via
 *   `resolveScriptCreateScope('partner', …)`, so a partner-scope caller who
 *   could not have CREATED a partner-wide script is refused (403) rather
 *   than silently getting an org-scoped downgrade of it (CLAUDE.md
 *   Partner-Wide First: never silently narrow ownership either). System-scope
 *   tokens carry no `partnerId` to preserve partner-wide under, so they must
 *   name a target org explicitly in this case too.
