/**
 * Wave 4 Part B — the deterministic built-in playbook executor (Task 5, #3826).
 *
 * `execute_playbook`'s ordinary tool implementation (`aiToolsPlaybooks.ts`) is
 * a STUB: it creates the `playbook_executions` audit row and hands the model
 * back the resolved step list, expecting the MODEL to call each step's tool
 * itself, turn by turn. That is fine for shadow/propose (a human reviews
 * every mutation anyway) but is NOT a rule-equivalent shape for unattended
 * act-mode execution — nothing server-side enforces that the model actually
 * runs the steps in order, respects `verifyCondition`, or stops on failure.
 *
 * This module is the real executor for act mode: it owns the ENTIRE
 * diagnose → act → wait → verify loop for a BUILT-IN playbook, server-side,
 * with no model turn in between. Every individually mutating step is
 * re-admitted through the SAME `revalidateActExecution` + reservation gate an
 * ordinary top-level act op goes through (actRevalidation.ts) — a playbook is
 * not a bypass, it is N individually-gated mutations wrapped in sequencing.
 *
 * Wiring (runLoop.ts): the pre-tool-use hook still calls
 * `revalidateActExecution` for the `execute_playbook` call itself first —
 * that is what pins the built-in's content digest (`ActAssetPin.playbookDigest`,
 * actRevalidation.ts's `pinPlaybook`) and reserves ONE `maxActionsPerRun` slot
 * for "running this playbook" as a unit. Only once THAT succeeds does the
 * hook call `executeBuiltInPlaybookForRun` here instead of dispatching the
 * stub tool — see runLoop.ts's own comment at the call site for why the
 * ordinary `recordAllowedExecution` path is skipped entirely for this one op.
 *
 * Custom (org-authored) playbooks never reach this module: `pinPlaybook`
 * downgrades anything that isn't an active, org_id-null, is_built_in row to a
 * PROPOSAL before revalidation ever succeeds — this executor only ever sees a
 * `playbookId` that has already been proven built-in.

 * no ambient context at all (the normal case, since the SDK's own
 * `makeHandler` already ran `runOutsideDbContext` before this executor was
 * ever reached).

 * Wrapped PER CALL, not around the whole playbook loop: a `wait` step can
 * sleep up to 60s, and pinning a pooled connection idle-in-transaction across
 * that sleep is exactly the #1105 pool-poison class this repo has hit before.
