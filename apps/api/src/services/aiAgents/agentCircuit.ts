/**
 * Wave 6 PR 2 (#3828), Task 2 — the per-org circuit breaker.
 *
 * `classifyTerminal` decides, per terminal run outcome, whether the (org,
 * agent) failure counter increments, resets, or is left alone (`neutral`).
 * `recordRunTerminal` is the ONLY writer of `ai_agent_circuit_state` — called
 * exclusively from `runService.ts`'s `transitionRunStatus`, which is in turn
 * the ONE place a run's status may become terminal (see the terminalization
 * contract test, `runService.terminalization.contract.test.ts`). Nothing in
 * this module ever mutates `ai_agent_runs` — the circuit watches run
 * outcomes, it never produces one (self-review: "admission-only, never
 * terminates in-flight work").
 *
 * `isCircuitOpen` is the admission-time READ (`createAndEnqueueAgentRun`).
 * `resetCircuit` is the ONLY way a circuit closes once open — always a human,
 * always MFA-gated, NEVER automatic (wave-6 quorum, 2026-08-28): a clean
 * success after the circuit has already opened (an in-flight run that was
 * admitted before the open) still zeroes the failure counter via `reset`
 * classification, but deliberately never flips `state` back to `closed` —
 * only `resetCircuit` does that.

/**
 * Pure, exhaustive-tested classification of one terminal run transition.
 *
 * - `increment`: `failed` with a runner/ceiling error code, OR `completed`
 *   with `runVerdict === 'needs_attention'` (the agent finished but flagged
 *   something a human needs to look at — treated the same as a failure for
 *   circuit-breaker purposes, per the wave-6 quorum).
 * - `reset`: a clean `completed` (no `needs_attention`), or `awaiting_approval`
 *   (the agent did real, unflagged work and handed a decision to a human).
 * - `neutral`: `cancelled`, `expired`, `skipped` — and a `failed` whose error
 *   code is not on the increment allowlist (`stalled`, `enqueue_failed`, or
 *   anything unrecognized). Also the safe default for a non-terminal status
 *   (`queued`/`running`), which callers must never actually pass here.
 *
 * `profile` (phase 2 wave P2-1, default `'full'` so every pre-existing
 * 3-arg call site keeps its old behavior unchanged): a `verdict`-profile run
 * never touches the org's failure streak either way — `completed` and
 * `awaiting_approval` both classify `neutral` regardless of `runVerdict`
 * (a verdict run never actually reaches `awaiting_approval`, but the
 * classification stays honest rather than assuming that). `failed` is
 * unaffected by profile — the runner/ceiling increment allowlist still
 * applies, since a verdict run can genuinely error out the same way a full
 * run can.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-2 (scheduled sweeps, design-review ruling): a
 * `sweep`-profile run gets the SAME `completed`/`awaiting_approval` →
 * `neutral` treatment as `verdict`, for a different reason — a sweep run's
 * success says nothing about the org's remediation health (it is read-only
 * reconnaissance, never a remediation attempt), so it never RESETS the
 * streak, clean or `needs_attention` alike; a genuine failure still
 * increments, exactly as for every other profile.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-3 (weekly org narrative): a `narrative`-profile run is
 * classified identically, and it is the strongest case of the same argument
 * — a narrative run does not even READ live data (its whole input is the
 * pre-collected weekly context) and its tool floor holds nothing but the
 * outcome tool, so its outcome carries no information whatsoever about
 * whether the org's remediation is working. It must therefore never reset a
 * streak the fleet's real remediation runs earned, nor increment one on a
 * `needs_attention` verdict about last week's prose. `failed` stays
 * profile-independent: a narrative run can hit `llm_unavailable` or blow the
 * turn/budget ceiling exactly like any other, and that is a real signal.
 *
 * Phase 2 wave P2-4 (ticket triage, #4191): a `triage`-profile run gets the
 * SAME `completed`/`awaiting_approval` -> `neutral` treatment, for the
 * same-shaped reason as `narrative` — it does not read any live data (its
 * whole input is the system-assembled ticket context) and its output is a
 * PROPOSAL a human must still accept before anything changes, so a clean
 * completion carries no information about the org's remediation health
 * either. `failed` stays profile-independent here too.
 *
 * Fleet Designer (W01): a `design`-profile run gets the SAME
 * `completed`/`awaiting_approval` -> `neutral` treatment as `narrative` and
 * `triage`, for the same-shaped reason — a design run reads a bounded,
 * system-assembled evidence bundle (never live tool output beyond its own
 * small read-only drill-down floor) and produces a fleet DESIGN, not a
 * remediation attempt, so its outcome carries no information whatsoever
 * about whether the org's remediation is working. It must never reset (or
 * increment) the streak either way. `failed` stays profile-independent: a
 * design run can genuinely blow the turn/budget ceiling or hit
 * `llm_unavailable` exactly like any other profile, and that is a real
 * signal.
 *
 * NOTE for whoever adds the next profile: this function compares `profile`
 * as a plain string and has NO exhaustive `never` guard (unlike
 * `profileCaps` in `runService.ts` or `outcomeToolsForProfile` in
 * `outcomeTools.ts`). Adding a value to `AI_AGENT_RUN_PROFILES` will NOT
 * fail to compile here — it will silently inherit `full`'s reset/increment
 * behaviour. `agentCircuit.test.ts` carries an explicit row per profile for
 * exactly that reason.
