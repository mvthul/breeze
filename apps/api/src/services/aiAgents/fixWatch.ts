/**
 * Wave 6 PR 2 (#3828), Task 3 — the fix-held watch's DB-side logic.
 *
 * After an act-lane remediation VERIFIES (`actVerify.ts`'s `verification:
 * 'passed'`), this module watches whether the alert that triggered the run
 * recovers, and — if it does — whether it recurs within `FIX_HOLD_MINUTES`.
 * The watch NEVER mutates the run's own outcome or status; it is a purely
 * observational, additive record (self-review note in the plan doc).
 *
 * Deliberately BullMQ-free, same reasoning as `runFinishedNotify.ts`: it is
 * imported by `runLoop.ts` (via `jobs/fixWatchWorker.ts`'s `scheduleFixWatch`,
 * see that file's header for why the enqueue side lives there instead), and
 * `runLoop.ts`'s own header keeps BullMQ out of its module graph so its
 * guardrail-hook tests don't have to stub Redis. `jobs/fixWatchWorker.ts` owns
 * the Queue/Worker plumbing and calls the phase functions below; this module
 * has no import of that file (or of `runLoop.ts`), so there is no cycle.
 *
 * Absence of recurrence is `held_qualified`, never an unconditional "held" —
 * alert dedupe/cooldown can suppress a would-be recurrence row, so silence is
 * evidence of nothing (wave-6 quorum, 2026-08-28). A `dismissed` alert can
 * never establish recovery (a human dismissing an alert is not the same as
 * the underlying condition clearing) — it cancels the watch instead.

 * would unwind the CAS, the watch-verdict evidence AND the operator-facing
 * recurrence alert together, leaving the watch back in `watching` — and
 * unlike a `pending` watch, a `watching` one is NOT recoverable:
 * `listPendingWatchesForRecovery` scans `state = 'pending'` only, so once
 * this phase-2 job exhausts its five BullMQ attempts the recurrence is
 * silently never reported at all. A key that outlives its revoke by one
 * sweep is strictly better than a recurrence no human ever hears about.
 *
 * A plain try/catch would NOT be enough, which is why this is a real nested
 * transaction with the executor threaded: postgres-js records the first
 * failed query of a transaction scope in that scope's `uncaughtError` and
 * rethrows it when the scope ends EVEN IF the caller caught the rejection
 * (`postgres/src/index.js`'s `scope()`), so a statement issued through the
 * ambient `db` proxy would abort the outer transaction no matter how it were
 * wrapped. `demoteSupervisedKey`'s second parameter exists for exactly this.
 *
 * Only COLON keys are considered: `policy_key` colon keys are the only thing
 * `supervisedActionKeys` ever holds, while an act-run watch's `op_keys` are
 * the manifest's DOT keys, which are not grantable and would never match.
 * The list is SORTED so that two concurrent multi-key demotes can never take
 * the same pair of `(org, agent, op_key)` advisory locks in opposite orders.
 * (Today an intent-anchored watch carries exactly one key and an act-run
 * watch carries none of this shape, so the multi-key case is defensive; a
 * deadlock there now rolls back to the savepoint and is captured, and the
 * verdict still stands.)

 * from in here. A contained failure returns `[]`: nothing was revoked, so
