/**
 * "How much did this run leave for a human?" — the ONE definition of
 * `findingsToReview`, plus the run-summary excerpt the list surfaces render
 * beside it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `runVerdict` understates a run: `no_action` is
 * computed from the run's own remediation outcome, so a sweep that found six
 * problems and was permitted to execute none of them still rolls up as "no
 * action". The run DETAIL page (apps/web/.../RunDetailPage.tsx) already
 * overrides the verdict badge with "N findings to review" — but it derives N
 * itself, from the detail DTO. The run LIST and the agents list have no
 * outcome payload at all (deliberately: see `mapRunListItem`), so they could
 * not, and rendered "No action" over unread findings.
 *
 * Putting the rule here — and using it on BOTH sides — is what stops the two
 * surfaces from badging the same run with different numbers.
 *
 * THE RULE: sweep findings + PROPOSED tool calls. A `denied` action is not a
 * finding: for a read-only profile it is the guardrail working as intended
 * (`runLoop.ts`'s `enforceReadOnlyProfile` logs one for every mutating tool
 * the model merely attempted), so counting it would inflate the badge with
 * denials nobody needs to act on. An `executed` action is not a finding
 * either — it already happened.
 *
 * TWO REPRESENTATIONS, ONE SOURCE. The detail route has the run's whole
 * `outcome` jsonb in memory and counts it in TypeScript
 * (`countFindingsToReview`). The two LIST routes must NOT pull that column —
 * `sweepFindingsOutcomeSchema` caps a run at 50 model-authored findings, so
 * shipping the blob for 25 list rows would move megabytes to count integers,
 * and the full outcome is exactly where this file's siblings' safe-projection
 * risk lives. They therefore count in Postgres (`findingsToReviewSql`), which
 * returns two bounded ints per row and no payload.
 *
 * Both representations are generated from `FINDINGS_TO_REVIEW_OUTCOME_PATHS`
 * below, so the part most likely to drift — WHICH outcome arrays count — has
 * a single definition. `runFindings.test.ts` pins both ends: a parity test
 * against the detail DTO's own numbers, and a compiled-SQL test asserting one
 * array-length term per path and no denied/executed term.
