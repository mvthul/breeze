/**
 * Prompt assembly for a headless agent run (AI agents wave 3c).
 *
 * The single security property this module exists to hold: **nothing written
 * here — and nothing an operator writes into `ai_agents.instructions`, and
 * nothing the agent later reads off a device — can move agent authority.**
 * Authority is structural: `checkAgentGuardrails(toolName, input, policy)`
 * takes the tool call and the run's immutable policy snapshot, and there is no
 * parameter through which prose could reach it. `instructions` is not a field
 * of `AgentGuardrailPolicy` at all.
 *
 * What this module CAN do wrong is blur the boundary between "what the operator
 * asked for" and "what the system said", so:
 *
 *  - operator text is fenced inside a single `<operator-guidance>` block whose
 *    preamble states, in the model's own context, that the block is preference
 *    and not authorization;
 *  - every delimiter-shaped substring is stripped from the operator text before
 *    it goes in, so the block cannot be closed early and continued as system
 *    voice (the classic fence-escape);
 *  - the task turn NEVER repeats the instructions — a second, undelimited copy
 *    would defeat the fence.
