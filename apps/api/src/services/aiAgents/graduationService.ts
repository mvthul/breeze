/**
 * P2-5 (#4192, Task A2-2) — the graduation window, the eligibility ladder and
 * the `tracking -> eligible -> promoted -> demoted -> tracking` state machine.
 *
 * Reads the `ai_agent_op_evidence` ledger (A1) over a TRAILING TIMESTAMP
 * window and persists the derived state onto `ai_agent_graduation`. The
 * window's lower bound is `GREATEST(now() - interval '30 days', demoted_at)`,
 * never a day bucket: a demotion and a re-verification on the same day have
 * to be unambiguously ordered, which is exactly why the wave dropped the
 * daily-counter table for an immutable ledger (spec §4.5 amendment).
 *
 * What this module does NOT do, deliberately:
 * - It never grants or revokes a key. The AUTHORITY is
 *   `ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys` on the ORG row; this table
 *   carries eligibility state and transition history only (spec §7, "the
 *   authority stays ai_agents.actAssets.supervisedActionKeys"). Promotion is
 *   Task 15's four-eyes executor, demotion is Task 16's negative-evidence
 *   path — `refreshGraduationRow` only ever writes `tracking` or `eligible`.
 * - It never consults `BREEZE_AI_AGENTS_POLICY_DECIDE_ENABLED`. Eligibility is
 *   an observation about evidence; the flag gates the promote WRITE, not the
 *   read (Task 15/18).
 *
 * Tenancy: every statement predicates on `org_id` explicitly even though it
 * runs under a system context (where RLS passes unconditionally), per the
 * wave's tenancy invariants. The partner baseline row is only visible to a
 * system or partner-axis reader, so the whole module elevates through
 * `inSystemDbContext` — the same join-or-open shape `resolveEffectiveAgentSystem`
 * and `agentCircuit` use.

 *
 * Unlike every other export in this module it runs under the CALLER's
 * request DB context and does NOT go through `inSystemDbContext`. The others
 * read the PARTNER baseline agent row, which an org token cannot see, so
 * they must elevate. This one reads `ai_agent_graduation` only — Shape 1
 * (`org_id NOT NULL` + `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`) — so the caller's own
 * RLS context is a real gate, and elevating would THROW IT AWAY. Do not
 * "harmonize" this with the rest of the file.
 *
 * `orgCondition` is `auth.orgCondition` (`middleware/auth.ts:125`), applied
 * on top of RLS for the reason `impactQuery.ts` states: partner scope means
 * ACCESSIBLE orgs, not every org under the partner. `orgId` narrows to one
 * org and is what makes a system-scope caller (whose `orgCondition` returns
 * `undefined`) still land on exactly the org it named.
 *
 * Reads the persisted `state`; it never re-derives eligibility. That column
 * is written by `refreshGraduationRow` above (the only writer of
 * `tracking`/`eligible`), by the promote executor (`promoted`) and by the
 * demote path (`demoted`), so this count can lag a window change by at most
 * one daily evaluation pass — the caller must present it as a link to the
 * graduation panel, which re-derives per read, not as an authoritative list.
