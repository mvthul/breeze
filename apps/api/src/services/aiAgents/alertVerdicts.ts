/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-1 (alert verdicts) — Task 8. Persists the `AlertVerdictOutcome`
 * a `verdict`-profile run produced (`runLoop.ts`'s `finalizeVerdict`), converts an
 * optional `suggestedAction` into a Tier-2 `supervised` `manage_alerts`
 * action-intent for the `ai_agent` principal (Task 3's `createActionIntent`
 * contract), and provides the safe `AiAgentRunAlertVerdictDto` projection
 * `runTrace.ts` puts on the wire.
 *
 * `persistAlertVerdict` is called from the background run loop (no ambient
 * request context), so its own reads/writes run inside a local system db
 * context — same duplicated-per-file `inSystemDbContext` pattern as every
 * other file in this directory (agentCircuit.ts, fixWatch.ts, runService.ts,
 * …).
 *
 * `createActionIntent` is called OUTSIDE that wrapper, deliberately (review
 * round 1 correction). Nesting `inSystemDbContext` inside an ALREADY-system
 * context is not itself the hazard — `withDbAccessContext` early-returns
 * `fn()` directly when a context is already active, so it would just share
 * this file's own transaction, not open a second one. The actual hazard is
 * that `createActionIntent` internally calls `runOutsideDbContext(...)` at
 * several points (its best-effort push-token/notification paths — see
 * `intentService.ts`) specifically to ESCAPE whatever ambient context is
 * active, INCLUDING one this file opened, before opening its OWN fresh
 * system-scoped transaction for that inner work. That inner transaction is
 * a genuinely second pooled connection, held WHILE this file's own
 * transaction is still open (the outer async chain is still awaiting
 * completion) — for however long that inner call takes. Calling
 * `createActionIntent` bare avoids ever holding two connections at once for
 * this path; this mirrors `runLoop.ts`'s `recordProposal`, which calls
 * `createActionIntent` bare for the same reason.
 *
 * `latestVerdictsForAlerts` / `latestVerdictForGroup` / `recordVerdictFeedback`
 * are request-path helpers (explicit `orgId`/RLS-scoped `id` lookups) and are
 * NOT wrapped in a system context — they run inside the caller's own
 * `withDbAccessContext`, same as every other read in `routes/aiAgents.ts`.
 *
 * Write ordering (review round 2, Minor 4): the verdict row is written
 * (with `suggestedIntentId: null`) and superseded BEFORE `createActionIntent`
 * is ever called; the intent id is linked back with a separate `UPDATE`
 * afterward, only when one was actually created. A crash/throw between the
 * write and that final `UPDATE` leaves a verdict row with no linked intent
 * (a `NULL` suggestedIntentId is a valid, already-handled state — see
 * `projectAlertVerdict`) rather than a live, human-approvable intent nobody
 * can find because the verdict row it belongs to was never written.
 *
 * Write ordering, part 2 (carry-in C, P2-1 Task 14 — live-verdict partial
 * unique): `ai_alert_verdicts_live_{alert,group}_uq` (migrations/
 * 2026-09-22-ai-alert-verdicts-live-unique.sql) allows at most one LIVE
 * (`superseded_by IS NULL`) row per target. The original INSERT-then-
 * supersede ordering above would ALWAYS violate that index for the instant
 * both rows are live at once, so the id is generated CLIENT-SIDE
 * (`randomUUID()`) and the two statements are flipped: supersede the
 * existing live row(s) to point `superseded_by` at the not-yet-inserted id
 * FIRST, then INSERT the new row with that id. The self-referencing
 * `superseded_by` FK is `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` (same migration)
 * specifically so the UPDATE naming a not-yet-existent id does not fail
 * immediately — it is checked once, at COMMIT. Both statements already run
 * inside ONE transaction: `inSystemDbContext` / `withSystemDbAccessContext`
 * wraps its callback in `baseDb.transaction(...)` (db/index.ts) — no
 * additional `db.transaction` call is needed here.
 *
 * A concurrent second run targeting the same alert/group either has its own
 * UPDATE match zero rows (this transaction's commit already flipped
 * `superseded_by` away from `NULL`) and then 23505s on its own INSERT, or
 * commits first and makes THIS transaction's INSERT the one that 23505s.
 * Either way one of the two racing writers loses; `persistAlertVerdict`
 * catches that 23505 (via `isPgUniqueViolation`, scoped to the specific
 * partial-unique constraint for the target kind — never a bare `error.code`
 * check, which would also swallow an unrelated conflict), re-reads the
 * winner's live row, and returns `suggestionReason: 'superseded_concurrently'`
 * — the loser's verdict is dropped, not retried, and no intent is attempted.
 * If that re-read finds no live row, it throws rather than fabricating an
 * id (MINOR 3, fix round 1) — with the partial unique in place a 23505 on
 * this constraint guarantees a live row exists, so a missing one means the
 * invariant broke and an honest failure beats a silently wrong verdictId.
 *
 * MINOR 4 (fix round 1) — this recovery mechanism REQUIRES
 * `persistAlertVerdict` to never be called from inside an ambient DB
 * context; see the precondition on the function's own docstring below for
 * why (a shared ambient transaction would abort on the 23505 and the
 * recovery SELECT would then fail with 25P02 instead of finding the row).

 * caller's `GET /alerts` list can legitimately span multiple orgs in one
 * page). An `inArray` widening was chosen over the alternative of the
 * caller grouping alert ids by org and issuing one call per org: the alerts
 * this function is ever asked about already came from a single prior
 * `alerts` query the caller ran under its own tenancy scoping (RLS plus, for
 * partner scope, an explicit `accessibleOrgIds` filter) — this is a second,
 * narrower read of the SAME already-authorized id set, not a new access
 * decision, so one widened query is both the smaller change and the cheaper
 * one (a single round trip instead of up to N).
 *
 * I3 fix (P2-1 wave B task 16d): `persistAlertVerdict` writes a group
 * verdict with `alert_id IS NULL` / `correlation_group_id` set — a
 * `duplicate_of_group` classification on the GROUP was otherwise invisible
 * to every member alert (neither this map nor `hideAiNoiseCondition` ever
 * matched it). Ruling: a group verdict applies to every member alert. Two
 * queries, not N:
 *   1. ALERT-level live verdicts for the requested ids — these WIN when an
 *      alert has both an alert-level and (via its group) a group-level
 *      verdict.
 *   2. For the ids still unmapped after (1), the latest live GROUP-level
 *      verdict of any correlation group the alert is a member of
 *      (`alert_correlation_members`, org-scoped on the join row — same
 *      tenancy axis `alert_correlation_members` already carries).

 * alone (no app-layer org predicate) is intentional, matching the `GET
 * /runs/:runId` route's own "RLS is the boundary, the app predicate is
 * defence-in-depth" precedent.
 *
 * Carry-in B (PR-A review) — a caller must not silently overwrite ANOTHER
 * user's already-recorded feedback (the SAME user changing their own mind is
 * fine). Task 7 (#4192, Deviation 12) moves that check INSIDE a `SELECT ...
 * FOR UPDATE` lock on the verdict row rather than leaving it as the prior
 * `WHERE feedback_by IS NULL OR feedback_by = <this user>` CAS: the lock is
 * held for the rest of this statement's ambient transaction, so no other
 * writer can race between the read and the write, and "not found" vs.
 * "someone else already voted" both resolve from ONE atomic read instead of
 * a CAS plus a non-atomic follow-up SELECT.
 *
 * A successful (re)vote also writes one `alert_verdict`-namespace
 * `feedback_up`/`feedback_down` op-evidence row (Task 7,
 * `AI_AGENT_ALERT_VERDICT_OP_KEY`), upserted by `sourceId` so a re-vote
 * flips the SAME row's metric in place rather than adding a second one —
 * `upsertVerdictFeedbackEvidence`'s own docstring covers the exactly-once
 * mechanics. `occurredAt` is pinned to the verdict's own `createdAt` (a
 * fixed bucket), not the moment of the vote, so re-voting never moves the
 * row between graduation-window buckets. There is no backfill of feedback
 * recorded before P2-5 shipped — pre-existing votes simply have no evidence
 * row and are invisible to `graduationService`.
