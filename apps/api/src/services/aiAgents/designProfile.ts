 * Fleet Designer (W01). The read-only drill-down floor a design run gets so
 * the model can check a function guess against one device — the evidence
 * bundle cannot carry every device's detail (spec §4.2, D6). Every name is a
 * tier-1 / read-only tier-2 catalog tool (designProfile.test.ts asserts it)
 * AND is declared in `createBreezeMcpServer` — the single MCP server a
 * design run attaches (also asserted in designProfile.test.ts). Floor, not
 * intersection: the agent's own allowlist is ignored, like
 * narrativeToolAllowlist / sweepToolAllowlist.
 *
 * `get_script_details` is deliberately absent: it is a `TOOL_TIERS` key and
 * a catalog tool, but it is only declared on the separate `script_builder`
 * MCP server (`scriptBuilderTools.ts`; see `NOT_IN_BREEZE_MCP_SERVER` in
 * `aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts`), so `createBreezeMcpServer`'s
 * `onlyTools` rejected it with "referenced unknown tool name(s)" and every
 * design run died at turn 0. No breeze-MCP-declared tool serves the same
 * "read one script's content/metadata" purpose today (`get_script_proposal`
 * reads an authoring proposal, not a library script; `get_script_execution`
 * reads a run's result, not the script) — dropped rather than swapped.

 * (`runLoop.ts`) falls back to the shared 600s default, which cut design
 * runs mid-reasoning well before the raised `maxTurnsPerRun`/
 * `maxBudgetCentsPerRun` ceilings above were ever reached — observed
 * 36/60 turns, 98/300 cents, `wallClockExceeded=true`, yet the run still
 * finalized `completed` because `outcome.fleetDesign` had been submitted.
 * Same pinning shape as `analysisLimits()`'s `analysisWallClockSeconds`.
