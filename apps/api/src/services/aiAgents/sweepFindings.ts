/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-2 (scheduled sweeps) — Task A7. Turns the
 * `SweepFindingsOutcome` a `sweep`-profile run produced (`runLoop.ts`'s
 * `finalizeSweep`) into (a) durable per-finding proposal bookkeeping on the
 * run's `outcome` jsonb and (b) at most `maxActionsPerRun` DEVICE-SCOPED,
 * supervised action intents — plus the safe `AiAgentRunSweepDto` projection
 * `runTrace.ts` puts on the wire.
 *
 * Direct sibling of `alertVerdicts.ts` (wave P2-1's `persistAlertVerdict`);
 * read that file's header first — the DB-context rules, the
 * `pending_approval`-only linking contract, and the "never carry a raw
 * `Error.message` onto a persisted record" posture are all identical here.
 * The two differences are structural:
 *
 *  1. A sweep run is DEVICE-LESS (`ai_agent_runs.device_id IS NULL`): one run
 *     walks a whole fleet. Every intent it mints therefore carries an
 *     explicit `scope: { deviceId }` (Task A3's `action_intents.scope_kind` /
 *     `scope_device_id`), which is what lets `checkAgentGuardrails` resolve a
 *     target device at release time for a run that has none of its own.
 *  2. There is no dedicated table. A sweep's findings are model-authored
 *     narrative, not a classification other surfaces query — they live on the
 *     run row's `outcome` jsonb, written by `finishRun`'s single existing
 *     outcome write. This module performs NO writes of its own; it returns
 *     the records and intent ids for the caller to attach.
 *
 * ## The evidence set is the control, not the prompt
 *
 * `run.evidenceDeviceIds` is the set of device ids the SYSTEM actually loaded
 * for this run (`loadSweepEvidence`, Task 5). The sweep prompt tells the model
 * "only propose actions on devices in the evidence", but a prompt is not a
 * control: prompt text is assembled from rows whose display fields the model
 * can also read, and a crafted hostname could make a forged "evidence row"
 * look real in the rendered turn. So the FIRST gate below re-checks the
 * proposal's device against the set the loader returned, server-side, before
 * anything else happens — including before the device is even looked up.
 *
 * ## Gate order (per finding carrying a `proposedAction`)
 *
 *  1. `device_not_in_evidence` — `proposedAction.deviceId` must be in
 *     `run.evidenceDeviceIds`. The PROPOSAL's device is authoritative:
 *     `finding.deviceId` is `.nullable().optional()` on the schema, and the
 *     model omits it more often than it repeats it, so a present
 *     `finding.deviceId` need only AGREE with the proposal's device — an
 *     absent one is treated as agreeing, not as a mismatch. A
 *     present-but-different `finding.deviceId` is still refused; that is a
 *     genuinely contradictory finding, not an omission (bug fix, #4189 — the
 *     old "both must be set and equal" reading refused valid proposals
 *     whenever the model omitted `finding.deviceId`, silently, since a
 *     refusal is recorded on the outcome rather than surfaced as an error).
 *  2. `device_not_in_org` — the device must still resolve inside `run.orgId`
 *     and must not be an ephemeral (Quick Support) enrolment. Evidence is a
 *     point-in-time snapshot; a device can be deleted or moved to another org
 *     between collection and this call.
 *  3. `not_allowlisted` — the AGENT's own effective `toolAllowlist` (the run's
 *     stored `policySnapshot.effective`), matched as a bare tool name OR
 *     `tool:action`, exactly as `checkAgentGuardrails` matches. NOT the sweep
 *     profile floor (`sweepToolAllowlist`), which is a READ-only drill-down
 *     surface: a mutation is only proposed when the partner actually granted
 *     the mutating tool. Release time (`agentReleaseAuthority.ts`) re-checks
 *     this same authority, so gating here means a human is never asked to
 *     approve something that could not release.
 *  4. `max_actions_per_run` — the AGENT's `effective.limits.maxActionsPerRun`,
 *     passed in explicitly by the caller. Deliberately NOT the sweep profile's
 *     `sweepLimits().maxActionsPerRun`, which is a hard `0`: that zero governs
 *     what the RUN LOOP may execute or propose through the tool gate (a sweep
 *     executes nothing), not how many findings may become human-approvable
 *     intents.
 *  5. `createActionIntent(..., { scope: { deviceId } })` — linked ONLY when
 *     the returned snapshot is `pending_approval`. `createActionIntent` does
 *     not throw when nobody can approve: it commits the intent and instantly
 *     cancels it, returning that snapshot (P2-1 lesson — see
 *     `alertVerdicts.ts`). Linking a cancelled id would advertise a dead
 *     intent and break the "`intent_ids` are pending-only" invariant
 *     `routes/aiAgents.ts` depends on.
 *
 * The cap counts intents that were actually CREATED, not attempts — an
 * attempt that failed produced nothing for a human to approve, so it consumes
 * no slot. That mirrors `actRevalidation.ts`'s `reserved.count += 1`, which
 * likewise increments only after a successful reservation. The total number of
 * `createActionIntent` calls stays bounded regardless: `sweepFindingsOutcomeSchema`
 * caps a run at 50 findings.
