/**
 * runFinishedNotify — the run-finished notification delivery body (AI agents
 * wave 4a, Task 6, #3826).
 *
 * Pulled out of `runLoop.ts`'s old inline `notifyRunFinished` into its own
 * leaf module for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Both the normal in-loop path (`runLoop.ts`'s `finishRun`, immediately
 *    after the run's terminal status CAS commits) and the durable BullMQ
 *    retry lane (`jobs/agentNotifyRetryWorker.ts`) need to call the SAME
 *    notify body by `runId` alone — the retry worker has no in-memory
 *    `RunContext`, only the id its job payload carries, so it re-reads the
 *    run + agent + policy snapshot from the DB fresh. The run row is
 *    immutable by the time either caller reaches this: `finishRun`'s status
 *    CAS has already committed.
 * 2. `runLoop.ts`'s own header explicitly keeps BullMQ out of its module
 *    graph ("so that the guardrail hooks it builds can be driven by
 *    service-level tests ... without dragging BullMQ and Redis into their
 *    module graph"). A module imported by BOTH `runLoop.ts` and the BullMQ
 *    worker must itself stay BullMQ-free, or the two files become circular
 *    imports of each other (the worker needs the notify body FROM the loop;
 *    the loop needs the enqueue function FROM the worker). This module has
 *    zero BullMQ/Redis dependency, which is also what keeps
 *    `agentNotifyRetryWorker`'s import closure short enough to land
 *    `placement: 'global'` in the worker registry (see
 *    `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`) instead of inheriting
 *    `runLoop.ts`'s full SDK-tool `socket-owner` graph.
 *
 * Throws on ANY failure (DB read, recipient resolution, notification write)
 * — deliberately, unlike the old inline `notifyRunFinished`, which caught
 * everything itself. The two callers now own that decision differently:
 * `finishRun` catches it and enqueues ONE durable retry job (a notify
 * failure must never redefine the run's terminal status); the retry
 * worker's job processor lets it propagate so BullMQ's own `attempts` +
 * backoff (set at enqueue time) handles repeated failures — no manual
 * re-enqueue loop here.
