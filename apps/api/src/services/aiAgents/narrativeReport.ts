/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-3 (weekly org narrative), Task A7 — turns the
 * `NarrativeOutcome` a `narrative`-profile run produced (`runLoop.ts`'s
 * `finalizeNarrative`) into a durable, downloadable REPORT: one system-authored
 * `reports` definition per schedule plus one `report_runs` artifact per
 * occurrence, with `ai_agent_runs.report_run_id` linking the run to it.
 *
 * Direct sibling of `sweepFindings.ts` (`persistSweepFindings`) and
 * `alertVerdicts.ts` (`persistAlertVerdict`) — read either for the shared
 * DB-context posture. Three things are structurally different here:
 *
 *  1. **There IS a table, and it is somebody else's.** A narrative lands in
 *     `reports`/`report_runs`, the same two tables the human report builder
 *     writes to. That is deliberate: an MSP gets the weekly narrative in the
 *     same place as every other report, with the same download route, the same
 *     PDF renderer and the same RLS. The cost is that the row must carry
 *     provenance no human report ever needs — `execution_scope_principal_kind
 *     = 'system'` with a NULL acting user (`persistedSystemSiteScopeValues`,
 *     siteScope.ts) and `source_ai_agent_schedule_id` as the typed identity of
 *     the schedule that owns it. Everything downstream keys off those two:
 *     `reportScheduleWorker` refuses to execute a system-principal definition,
 *     and the report write routes refuse to mutate one.
 *
 *  2. **It is ONE transaction, and the run link is the commit gate.**
 *     `withSystemDbAccessContext` opens a real transaction and routes every
 *     `db` statement inside it onto that connection (see `db/index.ts`), so
 *     the whole body below is atomic without a nested `db.transaction`
 *     (which would only add a SAVEPOINT). The final statement is a
 *     compare-and-set on `ai_agent_runs.report_run_id`: if it matches zero
 *     rows — a second executor got there first, the stall reaper moved the
 *     run, the row left the org — the throw rolls the definition AND the
 *     artifact back. A narrative artifact that no run points at is an
 *     orphaned customer-facing document, which is worse than no document.
 *
 *  3. **Every statement is org-pinned by hand.** The system context bypasses
 *     RLS by design (it has to: it writes on behalf of no user), so `org_id`
 *     appears in the WHERE of the run lock, the definition read-back, the
 *     `last_generated_at` stamp and the run CAS. `narrativeReport.test.ts`
 *     asserts that against COMPILED SQL, because a mocked `.where()` cannot
 *     tell a present pin from a missing one.
 *
 * ## What reaches the stored snapshot
 *
 * `report_runs.result.summary.narrative` is an `OrgNarrativeReportSummary`:
 * the server-titled sections, the SERVER-DERIVED markdown (re-derived here via
 * `renderNarrativeMarkdown` rather than copied off the outcome, so the cap
 * holds even for a hand-built or legacy outcome), and provenance scalars. The
 * weekly `NarrativeContext` itself is NOT stored — only its `period`,
 * `org.name`, `org.partnerName` and `truncated` flag. The context is a whole
 * organization's activity assembled under a system context to be rendered into
 * ONE prompt; `runLoop.narrative.test.ts` and `runTrace.test.ts` both carry
 * tripwires against it reaching a persisted row.
