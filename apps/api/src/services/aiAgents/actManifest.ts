/**
 * Wave 4 Part B — the act-mode manifest.
 *
 * `ACT_MANIFEST` is the closed, hard-enumerated set of rule-equivalent
 * operations an act-mode agent may execute unattended. It is a FROZEN
 * LITERAL: growing it is a quorum decision (docs/superpowers/plans/ai-mcp/
 * 2026-08-27-ai-agents-wave4-b-act-mode.md), not a routine code change —
 * `actManifest.test.ts` pins the exact key set so an accidental addition
 * (or a silent removal) fails CI, not review.
 *
 * `resolveActOperation` is PURE and does NO I/O: it is called synchronously
 * from `checkAgentGuardrails` on every tool dispatch, so it can only decide
 * from the tool name + the input the model already sent. Anything that needs
 * a database round trip — is this playbookId actually a built-in row, does
 * this scriptId's digest still match, does a preview plan exist for this
 * device — is NOT decided here. It is decided by `revalidateActExecution`
 * (actRevalidation.ts, Task 3), which runs AFTER this resolver, with I/O,
 * against LIVE state, before anything executes. A `resolveActOperation` match
 * is necessary but never sufficient for execution.

 * (aiAgentSdkTools.ts), i.e. never a real agent-SDK tool, so no dispatch
 * could ever reach a `resolveActOperation('manage_processes', ...)` match in
 * production. The pid→name identity pin the quorum required for an
 * unattended kill (the same real, dispatch-time revalidation
 * `pinDiskCleanup` does for disk-cleanup paths) was also never implemented —
 * only asserted in comments. Under act mode a `manage_processes` kill call
 * now falls through to the ordinary unmatched-mutation path, exactly like
 * shadow mode: no capability regression, since nothing could execute it
 * before either.
 *
 * Re-admitting this op requires BOTH, together, before it returns:
 *   (a) `manage_processes` tiered and registered in the agent SDK tool set —
 *       today it sits in `KNOWN_MISSING_TOOL_TIERS`
 *       (aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts), a frozen list that
 *       may only ever SHRINK, never grow to paper over this gap, and
 *   (b) a real dispatch-time pid→name identity pin added to
 *       `actRevalidation.ts`'s `pinAsset` (an `executeCommand list_processes`
 *       read + name match immediately before the kill dispatches, mirroring
 *       `pinDiskCleanup`'s preview-plan re-read) — not a presence check on
 *       the model's own input.
 * Follow-up issue reference to be added at PR time.
