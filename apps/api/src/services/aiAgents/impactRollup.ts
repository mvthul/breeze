/**
 * Phase 2 wave P2-6 (#4193) — the `ai_agent_impact_daily` rebuild service.
 *
 * Persistence mirrors `services/metricRollups.ts` end-to-end: ONE idempotent
 * `INSERT … SELECT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` per (org, range) over a
 * `generate_series` day grid, run inside its OWN short-lived labelled system
 * context preceded by `runOutsideDbContext`.
 *
 * CALLERS MUST NOT WRAP THESE FUNCTIONS IN THEIR OWN DB CONTEXT. The
 * `runOutsideDbContext` escape is not decoration: without it a caller's
 * ambient context would make the inner `withSystemDbAccessContext`
 * short-circuit into that transaction and collapse the short hold into a long
 * one (the alertWorker/#3216 trap). WITH the escape an outer wrap is instead
 * defeated — it does no work and merely pins a second idle-in-transaction
 * connection for the whole pass. The rollup worker and the integration suite
 * both call these bare.
 *
 * Every bucket boundary is an explicit UTC calendar day. `date_trunc('day',
 * <timestamptz>)` is deliberately never used anywhere in this file: it follows
 * the session timezone, which a self-hoster can change, so it would silently
 * re-bucket an entire fleet's history. Ranges are bounded half-open on
 * `(<day>::date)::timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` instead, which keeps the
 * predicates sargable against the source indexes this wave adds.
 *
 * THE `::timestamp` IN THAT BOUND IS LOAD-BEARING, not noise. `AT TIME ZONE`
 * has two overloads — `timezone(text, timestamp) -> timestamptz` and
 * `timezone(text, timestamptz) -> timestamp` — and a bare `date` casts
 * implicitly to BOTH, so Postgres resolves the ambiguity toward the preferred
 * datetime type, `timestamptz`. `(<day>::date) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` therefore
 * reads the day as a SESSION-LOCAL instant, converts it to a naive UTC
 * `timestamp`, and then gets compared back against a `timestamptz` column in
 * the session zone again — shifting the bound by TWICE the session's UTC
 * offset. Under a UTC session it is a no-op, so it passes every unit test and
 * every local run; under `TimeZone = America/New_York` it silently drops
 * (and mis-buckets) facts near the range edges. Caught by
 * `__tests__/integration/aiAgentImpact.integration.test.ts`'s NY-session case;
 * the explicit `::timestamp` pins the `timezone(text, timestamp)` overload so
 * the bound is the true UTC midnight in any session. `generate_series` has the
 * same pair of overloads and is pinned the same way.
 *
 * The bucketing expressions themselves — `(<column> AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::date`
 * — need no such cast: the argument is already a `timestamptz` column, so only
 * one overload matches.
