/**
 * Contract test: the backup surface may not construct a raw outbound HTTP/S3
 * client from a tenant-supplied endpoint.
 *
 * The security finding this guards was *incomplete adoption*, not absent
 * defense. `services/urlSafety.ts` has been a strong SSRF guard for a long time
 * — DNS-resolved, IP-pinned, Host header discarded, redirects not followed,
 * metadata/link-local/CGNAT blocked — and the backup surface simply never
 * imported it, while `routes/backup/configs.ts` handed a tenant-controlled S3
 * endpoint straight to the AWS SDK from a *test connection* route.
 *
 * Fixing the three call sites is the perishable half of that fix; a new backup
 * feature can silently regrow the same hole next quarter. This test is the
 * durable half: it scans the source text of the backup surface and fails on any
 * outbound client that is not built through `createGuardedS3Client`
 * (`services/guardedS3Client.ts`) or `safeFetch`.
 *
 * Adding a legitimate exception is deliberately awkward — put it in ALLOWLIST
 * with a written reason.
