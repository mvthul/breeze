 *
 * Maintenance windows are OWNED HERE (#4919). They used to be "the caller's
 * job", and three of the four callers never did it — an assistant-, automation-
 * or auto-migration-initiated script ran on a device where the identical
 * human-initiated run would have been suppressed. The gate now lives on this
 * seam so every path inherits it, and it is fail-closed: `bypassMaintenanceWindow`
 * is the only way past it and no caller sets it today.
 *
 * Callers own: auth, site permissions, batching, and any caller-specific
 * status bookkeeping (e.g. automation's 'queued' state).
 * Inserts run in the caller's ambient DB context — request paths stay under
 * RLS; system-context callers must validate ownership before calling.

  // #3826 Wave 4A Task 3: agent principals reach dispatch through the SAME
  // handlers humans use (an `ai_agent` AuthContext's `auth.user.id` is the
  // agent's `ai_agents.id`, not a `users.id` — see
  // services/aiAgents/agentAuthContext.ts). Both `triggeredBy` (inserted
  // below into `script_executions.triggered_by`, FK -> users.id,
  // schema/scripts.ts:126) and `createdBy` (forwarded to queueCommand, whose
  // `device_commands.created_by` is the SAME FK shape) would otherwise die on
  // a 23503 the first time an agent-released run reaches here. Mirrors the
  // shipped `commandQueue.ts:855-889` probe precedent: one indexed PK lookup
  // on whichever id is present, run inside `withSystemDbAccessContext` (same
  // as the precedent) since `users` is an RLS-forced dual-axis table and a
  // contextless read DENIES rather than bypassing — any id that isn't a
  // users row degrades to NULL on both columns rather than aborting the
  // dispatch.
  //
  // Single probe for both columns: every real caller passes the SAME id for
  // triggeredBy and createdBy (or supplies only one — automation's raw
  // command action has no execution row and so no triggeredBy at all), so
  // one lookup on whichever is present settles both writes. `createdBy` is
  // preferred as the probe candidate since it is the one that always reaches
  // queueCommand.
  //
  // #4299: the probe must ESCAPE the caller's context before opening the
  // system one. `withDbAccessContext` short-circuits when a store already
  // exists, so `withSystemDbAccessContext` on its own is a no-op inside a
  // request — the "system" probe silently inherits the caller's scope. Under
  // the org-scoped, user-less context `dbAccessContextFromAuth` builds for an
  // `ai_agent` principal, a partner-level human (`users.org_id IS NULL`)
  // matches NO branch of the RLS SELECT policy on `users` (partner access is
  // not granted to an org-scoped caller, the org branch is skipped on a NULL
  // `org_id`, and `breeze_current_user_id()` is null), so the probe reads zero
  // rows and degrades a REAL human to NULL on both columns. This path is
  // FK-safe, so that damage is silent — no 23503, just attribution quietly
  // lost. `runOutsideDbContext` clears both stores, which is what lets the
  // nested `withSystemDbAccessContext` open a genuinely fresh system-scoped
  // transaction. Mirrors the fix shipped for `resolveCommandCreatedBy` in
  // commandQueue.ts (#4292); note the directly-imported `runOutsideDbContext`

 * Load the two builtin values that are not columns on the device row.

 * script that doesn't bind them — which is all of them today.
 *
 * Runs in the caller's ambient DB context deliberately: the caller was
 * already authorized to dispatch to this device, so an org-scoped request
 * transaction can read its own org/site, and the system-context callers
 * (automation worker, AI tools) are unconstrained. No context escape is
