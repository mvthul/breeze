/**
 * AI Tools — shared site-axis (app-layer authz) helpers.
 *
 * Site is an app-layer authz axis — Postgres RLS does NOT defend it. Several
 * device-touching AI tools read/act on devices scoped only by org, which lets a
 * site-restricted chat/MCP caller (`auth.allowedSiteIds` set) reach devices in
 * sites they lack access to. These helpers close that gap two ways:
 *
 *  - LIST/enumeration tools narrow their device set via
 *    `resolveSiteAllowedDeviceIds` (mirrors aiToolsBrowser.ts) — return rows
 *    only for in-scope devices instead of denying outright.
 *  - Per-deviceId tools that resolve a device indirectly (via a VM record,
 *    snapshot, alert, etc.) check the resolved device's `siteId` with
 *    `deviceSiteDenied` BEFORE reading/acting on device-scoped data. Per-device
 *    tools that look the device up by id directly should instead route through
 *    the site-gated `verifyDeviceAccess` in aiTools.ts.
 *
 * Site and exact-device restrictions are intersected. Human callers without
 * an exact-device restriction retain their existing site access.
