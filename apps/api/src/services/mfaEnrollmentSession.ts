 * (SR2-07/SR2-19); the replacement issuance is what keeps the actor who just
 * proved themselves from being evicted along with them — which matters most
 * when the response body carries a one-time secret the user has to read
 * (recovery codes, #4480): a caller signed out by its own request never sees it.
 *
 * Five shapes exist, differing only in `expectedMfaEnabled` and whether a code
 * set accompanies the write, and each has its own entry point: this function
 * is ROTATION on a protected account (factor must still exist, codes required);
 * `completeInitialMfaEnrollment` is INSTALL (factor must not exist yet, codes
 * required); `completeMfaFactorRemoval` is REMOVAL (factor must still exist, no
 * codes — a self-disable that evicted its own caller bounced the user to
 * /login?reason=session-expired the moment they turned MFA off, #4934);
 * `completeAdditionalMfaFactorEnrollment` is a SECONDARY ADDITION (factor must
 * still exist, no codes — the account's existing set stays valid, #5038); and
 * `completeMfaFactorReplacement` is a REPLACEMENT of the material behind a live
 * factor (factor must still exist, no codes — the account's existing set stays
 * valid, #5198). All five funnel into the same private core.
 *
 * Expensive recovery-code generation and hashing belong before this call; every
 * authority-bearing write happens inside finishAuthIssuance's supplied
 * transaction and plaintext codes are returned only after it commits.
 *
 * The replacement identity is the CALLER's — assurance is carried forward, never
 * elevated. Enrollment passes `mfa: true` because it just installed the factor;
 * a rotation or a removal passes whatever the caller's own token carried.
