/**
 * #5306 — the enrolment grace window for role-forced MFA.
 *
 * `roles.force_mfa` used to bite the instant it was set: the next request 428'd
 * the user into /auth/mfa/setup, and the only relief was the global
 * MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN kill switch (all users at once, or none). This
 * module turns that into a per-user notification period that ENDS in exactly
 * today's enforcement.
 *
 * Three properties the design leans on, in order of importance:
 *
 * 1. **The grant is durable and NONRENEWABLE.** The deadline is persisted, and
 *    the grant statement matches only `mfa_enrollment_deadline IS NULL`, so no
 *    code path can reopen or extend a window: not a re-login, not a role change,
 *    not the kill switch being toggled off and back on, and — deliberately — not
 *    an admin factor reset. A user who lost their authenticator and was reset
 *    still faces the immediate re-enrollment contract of
 *    `POST /users/:id/mfa/reset`, because their (past) deadline is still there.
 * 2. **A grant is only ever made to an account that has NEVER held a factor.**
 *    `mfa_epoch = 1` means no MFA mutation has ever been applied to the row
 *    (every enroll/disable/reset advances it), which is the conservative reading
 *    of "no factor yet": if in doubt we do not grant, and the caller enforces as
 *    it does today.
 * 3. **Partners may shorten, never lengthen.** The effective deadline is
 *    `min(persisted deadline, grantedAt + security.mfaEnrollmentGraceDays)`, so
 *    lowering the partner setting brings existing windows in (possibly to
 *    already-expired), while raising it only affects grants made afterwards.
 *
 * All timestamps come from the DATABASE clock — the grant, the deadline and the
 * "is it expired" comparison are one statement's `now()` — so a skewed API host
 * can neither extend nor prematurely end a window.
 *
 * "Enforcement" here means the live enrollment gate (authMiddleware's 428 and
 * the login/control-gate policy result). It does not retroactively revoke
 * credentials, API keys or sessions minted during the window; those keep their
 * own lifecycles.
 *
 * NOT wired into partner REGISTRATION on purpose. `/auth/verify-email`'s
 * auto-login mint keeps forcing enrollment for a brand-new partner admin
 * (RMM-QA-164 / SR2-21: `registerPartnerMfaPolicy.integration.test.ts` asserts
 * the mint carries `mfa: false` for that account). Signup is the moment MFA is
 * cheapest to set up and the upgrade-surprise this window exists to fix does not
 * apply there. A window is still granted if that owner abandons setup and comes
 * back through /auth/login later — first-seen is first-seen — but they will have
 * been shown the enrollment screen once, up front.
