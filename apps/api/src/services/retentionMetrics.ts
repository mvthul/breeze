/**
 * Prometheus observability for the retention job family and the metric-rollup
 * pipeline (#4345). Before this, `/metrics` said nothing about the ~15 retention
 * workers or the rollup runner: a job that silently stopped deleting, or one
 * permanently pinned at its MAX_BATCHES cap while its table grew, was invisible
 * until someone noticed the disk.
 *
 * Same shape as `services/actionIntents/metrics.ts` and
 * `services/anomalyMetrics.ts`: a settable recorder so `jobs/*` can emit without
 * importing `routes/metrics` (which pulls the whole metrics + backup graph and
 * would close an import cycle), plus a `register*` function that `routes/metrics`
 * calls once at startup to bind the real Prometheus instruments. Until that call
 * every `record*` here is a no-op.

/**
 * Closed set of instrumented jobs — the `job_name` label's only possible values,
 * so the series stays bounded. Sorted; keep it that way (asserted in the test).
 * Add a name here when you instrument a new retention worker.
 *
 * `jobs/backupRetention.ts` is deliberately absent: it is a library of two
 * separately-invoked sweeps (row-level snapshot cleanup and object-storage GC)
 * with two independent totals, driven from `jobs/backupWorker.ts`, and backup
 * already has its own dedicated instrument set in `services/backupMetrics.ts`.
