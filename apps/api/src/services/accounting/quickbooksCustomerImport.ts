/**
 * QuickBooks customer import — a thin adapter over the shared org import seam
 * (`services/orgImport`, issue #3242 / epic #3249).
 *
 * This module owns only what is QuickBooks-specific: connection + token
 * plumbing, the RemoteCustomer → ImportRow mapping, and the translation of the
 * seam's generic summary back into the customer-shaped contract the
 * integrations UI consumes. Matching, slug reservation, org/site creation,
 * link-row persistence and concurrent-import recovery all live in the seam.
 *
 * Linkage lives in `organization_external_links` ONLY. The legacy
 * `organizations.accounting_provider` / `accounting_external_id` columns were
 * backfilled into the link table on 2026-08-08 and dropped on 2026-08-18; no
 * reader or writer refers to them any more.
