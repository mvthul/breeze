/**
 * QuickBooks entity-mapping reconciliation (Phase B, Task 3 —
 * docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-quickbooks-customer-item-mapping.md).
 *
 * `listMappingProposals` is READ/PROPOSE ONLY: it never calls
 * `upsertCustomer`/`upsertItem` and never writes to QuickBooks. It compares
 * Breeze organizations/catalog items against QuickBooks Customers/Items and
 * returns a deterministic suggestion per Breeze entity. Confirming a
 * suggestion (`saveMappingDecision`) and pushing it to QuickBooks
 * (`syncMappedEntity`) are Task 4's job and land in this same file.
 *
 * Match priority (strict, first hit wins):
 *   1. current mapping row (`accounting_entity_mappings`) — already decided.
 *   2. `organization_external_links` import provenance (orgs only) — backfilled
 *      into a `confirmed`/`pending` mapping row on first sight so it becomes a
 *      case (1) hit on every later call.
 *   3. exactly one exact email match (orgs) / exact SKU match (items).
 *   4. exactly one exact normalized-name match.
 *   5. `ambiguous` (more than one candidate at the tier that was checked) or
 *      `none` (no candidate at any tier).
 * Candidates for tiers 3-4 exclude inactive remote entities and remote IDs
 * already claimed by another Breeze entity's mapping row. Soft-deleted orgs and
 * the hidden per-partner `quick_support` org never enter the candidate/target
 * set at all (query-level filters — `deletedAt IS NULL` and
 * `notQuickSupportOrg()`). Those two are NOT symmetric afterwards: a soft-deleted
 * org's mapping row keeps its claim on a remote id (it still occupies the
 * `accounting_entity_mappings_remote_uniq` slot), whereas the hidden org's rows
 * are ignored by id — as claims, as backfill targets, and in
 * `saveMappingDecision`'s conflict scan — so a remote Customer it once claimed
 * can be proposed to, and confirmed by, a real org. See
 * `loadQuickSupportOrgIds`.
 *
 * Ordinary suggestions (tiers 3-5) are NOT persisted — they are cheap to
 * recompute and must not become stale rows merely because a user opened the
 * screen. Only the imported-customer backfill (tier 2) is durable, because it
 * is provenance, not a guess.
