// This limiter sits after the refresh JWT's signature has been verified but

// volume guard, not an authorization control: it bounds how fast a caller
// holding a structurally-valid refresh token may spend it, protecting the
// Redis/Postgres session lookups, the rotation writes and the token mint from
// a runaway client (a stuck poll loop, a wedged tab). Credential-guessing is
// not its job — an attacker without a signed refresh token never reaches it,
// and raw request volume is separately capped by the global per-IP limiter.
//
// Why the budget moved from 10/60s per USER:
//
//  - `apps/web` is an Astro MPA and access tokens are memory-only, so EVERY
//    full-page navigation starts a fresh JS realm that must spend one refresh.
//    10/60s therefore capped a signed-in operator at ten page views per minute
//    — well inside normal triage pace. The eleventh navigation 429'd and the
//    client treated the throttle as an expiry and evicted to /login.
//    Reproduced at 10 navigations in 24 seconds.
//  - Keying per user meant one wedged browser tab starved the SAME person's
//    other devices. The family id is preserved across rotation, so a family is
//    effectively one browser profile's session chain — the granularity that
//    actually matches "one navigation, one refresh".
//
// 60/60s keeps the runaway-client ceiling low in absolute terms while putting
// it far beyond any human click rate, including several tabs at once.
// Operator-overridable at runtime (read per call, no restart needed) via
// AUTH_REFRESH_RATE_LIMIT / AUTH_REFRESH_RATE_WINDOW_SECONDS.
