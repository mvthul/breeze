/**
 * #3409 PR4c-2 — the activation gates for secret delivery.
 *
 * A `tenantSecret` parameter reaches the agent only inside the sealed
 * `secretEnvEnvelope` (scriptSecretEnvelope.ts), and only an agent that
 * declares `scriptSecretEnvVersion >= 1` (PR4b) knows to open it and export
 * `BREEZE_VAR_<NAME>`. An older agent silently ignores the field and runs the
 * script with the credential UNSET — so the rule is "fail loudly, never run":
 *
 *   - `secretDeliveryPreflight` at ENQUEUE (scriptDispatch), before the
 *     execution row exists, so a refused dispatch leaves no orphan. This is
 *     the ORDINARY case for any pre-PR4b agent, and it refuses with
 *     `agent_upgrade_required`.
 *   - `failClaimedSecretCommandsForUnsupportedAgent` at CLAIM (commandDelivery),
 *     because the capability is non-sticky (devices.ts: written every beat)
 *     and an agent can be downgraded between enqueue and delivery. RARE (it
 *     needs a downgrade race), and by the time it refuses it has already
 *     written both the command and the execution row — which is why dispatch
 *     reports it under the distinct `agent_upgrade_required_recorded` code.
 *
 * User-context runs — `user`, any explicit username, any targeted session —
 * are refused too: they execute through the helper IPC (or a `sudo -n`
 * re-exec), neither of which carries env, so the credential would simply be
 * absent. `runAsSupportsSecretEnv` mirrors the agent's own
 * `runAsSupportsSecrets` (agent/internal/heartbeat/handlers_script.go)
 * allowlist-for-allowlist.
 *
 * Nothing in this module ever sees a plaintext secret — it handles the
 * ciphertext envelope only as an opaque presence check — and no log line or
 * error string here carries the payload.
