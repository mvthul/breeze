/**
 * Daily partner-lane send cap (spec §9.1).
 *
 * A fixed-window counter per partner per UTC day, incremented and expired in
 * ONE round trip — the `services/m365ControlPlane/readActionBudget.ts` idiom,
 * on the same shared `getRedis()` client as the feature's other Redis state
 * (`services/emailDomains/keyProbe.ts`).
 * The increment happens even on the call that trips the limit: a denied send
 * still cost a slot, which makes the cap slightly conservative under bursts,
 * the safe direction for an abuse control.
 *
 * FAILURE DIRECTION: when Redis cannot answer, this returns FALSE — the send
 * goes out on the PLATFORM lane. That is the only option that satisfies both
 * halves of the contract at once: nothing is lost (spec G3 — the platform lane
 * still delivers the message from EMAIL_FROM), and an outage cannot silently
 * lift the abuse cap on partner-domain mail. Failing "open to the partner lane"
 * would turn a Redis blip into unbounded sending from customer domains; failing
 * "closed by throwing" would lose the mail outright. Cf. readActionBudget.ts,
 * which fails closed for the same reason but has no second lane to fall to.
