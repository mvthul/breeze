/**
 * Release every provider-side sending domain a partner still owns (spec §3.5).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `partner_sending_domains` carries a BEFORE DELETE trigger
 * that raises while `provider_domain_id` is set, so any path that deletes a
 * partner's rows without releasing first aborts loudly instead of silently
 * leaking a domain in the provider account. This is the one function that
 * satisfies the guard, and it is called FIRST in both partner-destroying paths.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The outbox row is written BEFORE the handle is
 * nulled, so a crash between the two leaves a releasable outbox row rather than
 * an orphaned provider domain nobody can name any more. The outbox table
 * deliberately has no partner_id, so cascadeDeletePartner's sweep leaves it
 * standing.
 *
 * `provider_managed = false` rows get their handle cleared but NO outbox row:
 * that provider domain pre-existed Breeze asking for it and is very likely the
 * operator's primary sending domain. Leaking one is recoverable; deleting
 * someone's mail domain is not.
 *
 * NO PROVIDER CALLS. This runs inside destructive paths that must not depend on
 * a third party being reachable; the worker drains the outbox later.
 *
 * DB CONTEXT. `withSystemDbAccessContext` JOINS an existing context rather than
 * nesting (db/index.ts:654-656), which is exactly right for the two callers:
 * `cascadeDeletePartner` holds none and gets a fresh system transaction;
 * `finalizePartnerOffboarding` already runs inside one (sweepOffboardingTenants
 * wraps it) and this joins it — no second pooled connection. Because joining is
 * unconditional, a future caller inside a REQUEST context would run these
 * writes under a tenant scope and match zero rows, so the ambient scope is
 * asserted first.
