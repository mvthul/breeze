/**
 * Per-partner delivery counters (spec §9.3).
 *
 * WRITE PATH. The only writer is the Resend delivery webhook
 * (routes/webhooks/emailProvider.ts). The send path never writes here: a
 * partner-axis write from sendEmail is forbidden by W04's Global Constraints,
 * so `sent` is counted from the provider's own `email.sent` event.
 *
 * The increment is ONE statement whose row source is a SELECT over `partners`:
 *
 *   INSERT INTO partner_sending_daily_stats (partner_id, day, <col>)
 *   SELECT p.id, $day, 1 FROM partners p WHERE p.id = $partner
 *   ON CONFLICT (partner_id, day) DO UPDATE SET <col> = … + 1
 *
 * Two properties fall out of that shape and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. A provider tag naming a partner that does not exist inserts ZERO rows.
 *     The alternative — letting the FK raise 23503 and catching it — would
 *     abort the surrounding transaction even though the error was handled
 *     (utils/pgErrors.ts; production incident 2026-09-15).
 *  2. Concurrent deliveries for the same (partner, day) serialise on the
 *     primary key inside ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE, so two workers processing two
 *     events never lose an increment. A read-modify-write in application code
 *     would.
 *
 * The column name is interpolated with sql.raw, which is safe because it is
 * looked up in the frozen STAT_COLUMNS set below and never taken from input;
 * anything else throws before a statement is built.
