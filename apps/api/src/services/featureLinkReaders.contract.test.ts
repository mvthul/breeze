// design decision, not a fix — see the spec's Resolver sweep section
// (docs/superpowers/specs/config-policy/2026-09-06-config-policy-inheritance-design.md).
//
// The mirror-image failure is just as bad: an *authored* surface that switched
// to the view would show a child's inherited rows as if the tech had authored
// them, and would let a DELETE/UPDATE target a row the child does not own. Each
