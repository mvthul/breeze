/**
 * Role-agnostic RUNTIME metrics: process identity, event-loop lag (#3022) and
 * Postgres pool health (#3214).
 *
 * Extracted from `routes/metrics.ts` for #4143. Every series here describes the
 * PROCESS, not the HTTP surface, so all of it is equally meaningful in a
 * worker-role container — and, per the incidents that produced #3022 and
 * #3214, it matters MOST there: the pool-exhaustion and event-loop-starvation
 * signatures were loudest on the patch scheduler and the heavy jobs, which is
 * precisely the work that moved off the api process in split-role mode
 * (#4086). Left inside the route file, none of it could be published by the
 * container running that work.
 *
 * Import closure: `prom-client`, `./metricsRegistry`, `./eventLoopMonitor`,
 * `./dbConnectTimeoutStats` and `../db/dbPoolHealthMonitor` — none of which
 * reach `routes/`, which is what lets `worker.ts` load this module at boot
 * without violating `services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`.
 *
 * Importing this module REGISTERS the series (module-scope `new Gauge({
 * registers: [metricsRegistry] })`). Registration is therefore per-process and
 * happens exactly once — a second import is a no-op, and a process that never
 * imports it publishes none of these series rather than publishing zeros.
