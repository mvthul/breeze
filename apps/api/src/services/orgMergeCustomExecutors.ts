/**
 * Hand-written org-merge executors (org-lifecycle Wave 2, Task 3).
 *
 * The registry (`orgMergeRegistry.ts`) classifies seventeen tables as `custom`.
 * Four were custom from the start (`contacts`, `backup_configs`,
 * `audit_baselines`, `pax8_orders`); ten were reclassified by review, in the
 * first three groups below; `ai_agents` arrived with main's AI-agents work and
 * hits both of the last two at once; `automation_resource_bindings` was added
 * when Track A met the exhaustive mainline registry; `ticket_drafts` (P2-4,
 * #4191) arrived later and is its own, fourth group. Each entry's registry note is
 * this file's spec — read them together.
 *
 *   - spec compliance: `api_keys` and `enrollment_keys` must be REVOKED rather
 *     than repointed (controller ruling R2), which no generic policy expresses;
 *   - the generic dedupe DELETE would have DESTROYED something — cascading
 *     children, per-org access scoping, or an incident's case file:
 *     `fleet_findings`, `organization_users`, `incidents`;
 *   - the generic dedupe DELETE would have ABORTED THE MERGE with 23503,
 *     because the row it removes has non-deferrable NO ACTION / RESTRICT
 *     children: `discovered_assets`, `plugin_installations`,
 *     `playbook_definitions`, `pam_signer_groups`, `reports`. These re-home
 *     their children onto the survivor's equivalent row and then delete the
 *     duplicate; see `rehomeChildrenThenDelete`.
 *   - no dedupe was ever involved — a SIBLING table's own plain `repoint`
 *     drags a composite FK out from under the row: `ticket_drafts` has
 *     `ticket_drafts_ticket_org_fk (ticket_id, org_id) -> tickets(id,
 *     org_id)`, and `tickets` repoints unconditionally, so any loser-org
 *     draft left in place disagrees with its own ticket's new org_id the
 *     instant `tickets` moves. The fix is an unconditional DELETE of every
 *     loser-org row, not a collision-keyed one — see `resolveTicketDrafts`.
 *
 * Contract, deliberately narrow so the engine stays uniform:
 *   - every executor runs inside the engine's ONE Phase-B transaction
 *     (`db` here is the ambient transaction proxy — never opens its own);
 *   - every executor leaves ZERO rows behind under the loser org;
 *   - `dropped` counts rows actually DELETEd, `moved` counts rows repointed,
 *     and `notes` carries anything an operator must see in the merge
 *     summary's `warnings` (demotions, deactivations, neutralizations and
 *     re-homings are not drops, but they are silent state changes, so they get
 *     surfaced);
 *   - executors run in the `move` phase unless they also appear in
 *     `CUSTOM_RESOLVE_EXECUTORS`, which is reserved for a table whose row
 *     must be gone BEFORE some other table's `move` half runs — a
 *     cascade-re-tenanted child racing its own parent's ON UPDATE CASCADE
 *     (`discovered_assets`, via `sites`), or a composite FK racing a
 *     SIBLING table's plain repoint (`ticket_drafts`, via `tickets`). Both
 *     reasons collapse to the same fix: run the DELETE in `resolve`, which
 *     completes for every table before `move` starts for any of them.
 *
 * NEVER add a DELETE to `contacts`, `backup_configs`, `audit_baselines`,
 * `fleet_findings`, `ai_agents` or `incidents`: their registry notes each
 * record the cascade, the credential material, the RESTRICT child or the case
 * file that a delete would take with it. `reports` deletes only the duplicate
 * DEFINITION, never a `report_runs` or `report_schedule_recipients` row — those
 * children are re-homed onto the surviving definition (after recipient
 * collisions are deduplicated).

// the point. AI Operator task history is source-org history for exactly the
// reason ai_agent_runs is (owner decision 2026-08-23): a task's evidence — its
// runs, its intents, its device command — all stays with the loser, so
// repointing the task alone would split one remediation's story across two
// orgs. `ai_operator_tasks.org_id` also anchors four composite (x, org_id)
// FKs, so a bare repoint would 23503 regardless.
//
// So why is this `custom` rather than plain `leave-for-erasure`, like
// ai_operator_operations and ai_operator_task_outbox next to it in the
// registry? Because leaving the rows ALONE is not safe. `mergeAiAgents`
// repoints every loser-org `ai_agents` row to the survivor, and a task still in
// a live state holds a lease, a next_wake_at and an agent_id — it would keep
// coordinating under a dead tenant, against an agent that now belongs to
// someone else, and could dispatch a real device command while doing it. The
// fence stops new work: state -> 'stopping' (spec §6.1's "cancel, expiry,
// handoff, authority loss" edge), lease released, wake cancelled, and the
// reason recorded in the exportable `outcome_detail` text column.
//
// It runs in the RESOLVE phase, which is what makes "before ai_agents
// repoints" true. The walk order is the reverse topological cascade order —
// parents first — and `ai_agents` is a PARENT of `ai_operator_tasks`
// (tasks.agent_id -> ai_agents.id), so in the `move` phase ai_agents would run
// FIRST. Resolve completes for every table before move starts for any of them,
// which is the only ordering that gets the fence in ahead of the repoint.
//
// In-flight effects are deliberately NOT touched. 'stopping' is not terminal:
// spec §6.3 requires that a late device-command result still land on its
// operation row, and the reconciler settles the task afterwards. Terminalising
// here would hide an effect that is still running on a real machine.

// did not, the runs are the customer's generated report artifacts, so dropping
// them is not on the table. The survivor's definition for the same schedule is
// the same weekly narrative under a different id, so the loser's run history

// same (untouched) report_runs rows, so run traces stay linked.
//
// The narrative key deliberately carries no keyWhere: `keyMatch` compares with a plain
// `=`, which is NULL-blind, so ordinary reports (NULL
// source_ai_agent_schedule_id) never match each other — exactly the semantics
