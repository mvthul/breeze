 * device `resolveNetworkCheckAlertDeviceForMonitor` picks, independent of that device's
 * online status — and this handler refuses to breach for any other device.

/**
 * `network_check` verdict handler (#5287 W04, #5291).
 *
 * A `network_check` monitor compiles to a managed `network_monitors` row that
 * the existing `monitorWorker` polls from an agent; this handler reads the
 * verdict back off `network_monitor_results`. The two halves are deliberately
 * decoupled through that table — nothing here talks to an agent.
 *
 * The results read is scoped to the EVALUATED DEVICE'S OWN ORG explicitly, and
 * must not rely on RLS to do it: the alert sweep runs this handler inside
 * `runWithSystemDbAccess` (jobs/alertWorker.ts), where
 * `breeze_current_scope() = 'system'` short-circuits
 * `network_monitor_results_isolation` to always-true. A partner-wide check
 * produces results for EVERY org under the partner against the same managed
 * row, so an unscoped read would blend those timelines: a healthy org would
 * inherit a sibling's outage, and a genuinely down org's streak would be
 * masked by a sibling's more recent `online` row.
 *
 * ONE ALERT DEVICE PER CHECK PER ORG (#6353): the probe runs once per org, so
 * the verdict is the org's, not any device's. The handler breaches only when
 * called for the device `resolveNetworkCheckAlertDeviceForMonitor` picks for
 * that org — the legacy network worker's rule, constrained to devices the
 * monitor's policy attachment reaches — and answers "not breaching"
 * for every other device an org-wide policy reaches. The device-independent
 * sweep (`networkCheckAlertSweep.ts`) is what calls it for the alert device,
 * online or not; the per-device sweep skips `network_check` rules entirely.
 *
 * `passed: true` means the monitor BREACHES.
