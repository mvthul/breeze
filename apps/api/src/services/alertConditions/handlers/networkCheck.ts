/**
 * `network_check` verdict handler (#5287 W04, #5291).
 *
 * A `network_check` monitor compiles to a managed `network_monitors` row that
 * the existing `monitorWorker` polls from an agent; this handler reads the
 * verdict back off `network_monitor_results`. The two halves are deliberately
 * decoupled through that table — nothing here talks to an agent.
 *
 * The results read is scoped to the EVALUATED DEVICE'S OWN ORG explicitly, and
 * must not rely on RLS to do it: the alert sweep runs this handler inside
 * `runWithSystemDbAccess` (jobs/alertWorker.ts), where
 * `breeze_current_scope() = 'system'` short-circuits
 * `network_monitor_results_isolation` to always-true. A partner-wide check
 * produces results for EVERY org under the partner against the same managed
 * row, so an unscoped read would blend those timelines: a healthy org would
 * inherit a sibling's outage, and a genuinely down org's streak would be
 * masked by a sibling's more recent `online` row.
 *
 * `passed: true` means the monitor BREACHES.
