/**
 * First-party system script library (#4072 follow-up).
 *
 * System scripts (`scripts.is_system = true`, org/partner NULL) are the shared
 * library behind Scripts → "Import from library" (`GET /scripts/system-library`
 * / `POST /scripts/import/:id`). The legacy dev seed (`db/seed.ts`) only runs
 * when someone invokes `pnpm db:seed`, so definitions added there never reach
 * an existing install. Entries in this module are ensured at API boot instead
 * (see the `ensureSystemLibraryScripts` call in `index.ts`), which is how a
 * library script ships to hosted production and to self-host installs alike.
 *
 * Write-path note: `services/scriptWrite.ts` is the chokepoint for USER-driven
 * script creation (tenancy resolution, partner-wide gate, isSystem clamp).
 * This module writes fixed first-party definitions under the system DB context
 * with no user input in scope — the same seed lane as `seedScripts` and
 * `seedBuiltInPlaybooks` — so none of those gates apply to it.

 * Identity-preserving Breeze Agent edition switch (self-hosted ⇄ hosted).
 *
 * Productization of the #4072 field remediation: agents on the stranded
 * self-host 0.105.x–0.106.x band cannot take a hosted-edition update over the
 * normal update channel, and each edition's MSI refuses to install
 * while the other edition is present (the OTHEREDITIONFOUND launch condition),
 * while a plain uninstall deletes the device identity. The dance below —
 * verify the target MSI first, back up identity, uninstall, restore identity,
 * install under a token-free filename — was proven in both directions on a
 * wedged field-replica device before being templated here.
 *
 * The MSI URL and SHA-256 pin are script parameters, not literals: hosting a
 * signed installer somewhere reachable is deployment-specific, and a stale
 * baked-in pin would brick the run at the hash check (by design, before
 * anything is touched).

#
# Switches an installed Breeze Agent between the self-hosted and hosted
# editions in place, preserving the device identity (agent.yaml /
# secrets.yaml) so the device keeps its row and history - no re-enrollment,
# no duplicate device.
#
# Why the dance: each edition's MSI refuses to install while the other
# edition's product is present, and a plain MSI uninstall deletes the
# identity files. So: download + pin-verify first, back up identity,
# uninstall the current edition, restore identity, then install the target
# edition from an MSI whose filename carries no enrollment token (so the
# installer keeps the restored identity instead of enrolling fresh).
#
# Parameters (all required):
#   msi_url        - HTTPS URL of the TARGET edition's MSI.
#   msi_sha256     - Expected SHA-256 of that MSI. Verified before anything
#                    is touched; on mismatch the device is left as-is.
#   target_edition - hosted | self-hosted
#
# EXPECT THIS COMMAND TO REPORT A TIMEOUT / NO RESULT when it succeeds past
# the uninstall step: the agent that would report the result is the one being
# replaced. Progress is written to C:\\ProgramData\\BreezeMigration\\migration.log
# and success shows as the device coming back online on its next heartbeat
# running the target edition.
