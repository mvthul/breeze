/**
 * Dynamic config layered over `app.json`.
 *
 * This file does three jobs, and two of them are build gates.
 *
 * 1. `ios.associatedDomains` — a self-hosted build can add its own domain.
 *    Apple binds Associated Domains into the signed entitlement, so the list is
 *    fixed at build time and cannot be a runtime setting — a self-hoster has to
 *    build the app themselves for their domain to associate. The published App
 *    Store build can never cover an arbitrary domain, which is a platform
 *    constraint rather than a gap here.
 *
 *      BREEZE_ASSOCIATED_DOMAINS=breeze.example.com npx expo prebuild -p ios
 *
 *    Accepts several entries separated by commas or whitespace and tolerates a
 *    pasted URL. The hosted regions in `app.json` are always kept, so this can
 *    only add to the list.
 *
 * 2. `extra.sentryDsn` — resolving the DSN here FAILS A RELEASE BUILD that has
 *    none. This file is the right home for that check because `expo-constants`
 *    runs `expo config` from an Xcode script build phase on every single build
 *    (see the long comment in `src/config/sentryDsn.js`), so unlike
 *    `scripts/preflight.mjs` — which is a manual step nobody runs, and which is
 *    why the mobile Sentry project sat at zero events for 90 days — it cannot
 *    be skipped by pressing ⌘B or Archive. Non-release builds are untouched.
 *
 * 3. `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` — the same treatment, for the same reason, on the
 *    variable that decides whether the app can reach a server at all. A release
 *    build with no API URL (or one pointing at `localhost`) compiles
 *    `http://localhost:3001` into the IPA and fails every request on a real
 *    device, silently. See `src/config/apiUrl.js`. Unlike the DSN it publishes
 *    nothing — it is only a gate.
 *
 * Plain CommonJS on purpose: Expo transpiles this file but not the modules it
 * requires, so the resolvers next door have to stay `.js` too.

      // placeholder key would hand `Sentry.init` an object as its DSN and make
      // a DSN-less dev build look configured. App.tsx also type-checks the
      // value it reads, so this is belt and braces.
