 * that could honor them — the foreground display handler never sees
 * background/lock-screen pushes, which is where approval pushes land. So the
 * row is now a status readout instead of a control: the one real control the
 * user has (the OS notification permission) lives in system Settings, and the
 * row deep-links there when that's actionable.
 *
 * Only `ok` may claim pushes are being delivered — every other status must
 * tell the truth that they aren't. In particular `failed` must carry the
 * explanation here too, because ApprovalGate's failure banner is dismissible
 * per session and this row is what remains after dismissal.
