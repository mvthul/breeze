/**
 * Copy for the approver-device setup banner.
 *
 * The banner this feeds used to say "This device isn't set up for biometric
 * approval", which reads as "turn on Face ID" — the one action that cannot
 * possibly fix it. The banner is about this phone's approver key not being
 * REGISTERED WITH THE SERVER; iOS biometric enrolment is unrelated, and toggling
 * it changes nothing. Copy here must stay honest about that.
 *
 * The only in-app remedy today is a fresh sign-in, because registration needs a
 * `register_approver_device` grant that is minted at login and is single-use
 * (see `services/approverDevice.ts`). A password / step-up re-mint via
 * `POST /api/v1/authenticator/register-grant` would allow retry without signing
 * out, but that endpoint 403s for accounts holding TOTP or a passkey, so it
 * needs its own step-up flow — tracked separately, not wired here.
