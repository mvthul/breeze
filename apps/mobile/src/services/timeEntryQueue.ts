 *
 * No migration is required: this feature is unreleased (both waves are
 * unmerged PRs), so no field install holds a v1 queue. A v1 row that somehow
 * survives is rejected by `asQueuedWrite` on its `kind`.

 * forever would wedge every later entry behind it, and deleting it would
 * silently destroy a record of real work. An auth, permission or throttle
 * failure is retried instead, and `headAttempts` is how a caller notices a
 * wedge.
 *
 * Calls are serialised: a flapping connection fires several false->true
 * transitions, and a concurrently replayed create would land twice.
 *
 * Rejects with QueueStorageError if storage cannot be read before any write is
 * sent; the queue is left untouched in that case rather than truncated.
