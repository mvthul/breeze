/**
 * Turns a queued write back into the API call that made it.
 *
 * Pure module (no React, no direct transport) so the mapping is unit-testable:
 * `drain` decides what to keep and what to park purely from the status on the
 * error this sender throws, which makes the mapping a correctness surface, not
 * glue.
 *
 * `startTimer` and `stopTimer` are deliberately ABSENT from `ReplaySenders`.
 * Both are server-stamped verbs — the server writes `new Date()` for the bound
 * they set — so replaying one rewrites when the work happened. Their absence
 * from this interface is what makes that a compile error rather than a
 * convention somebody re-reads and re-breaks.
