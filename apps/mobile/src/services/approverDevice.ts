/**
 * Breeze Authenticator (Phase 3) — mobile hardware-key approver client.
 *
 * Bridges the device's biometric-gated signers to the server approver
 * endpoints. There are TWO registration paths, and which one runs decides the
 * assurance ceiling of every approval this phone ever makes:
 *
 *  - **Attested (#1374 W05/W06).** When `attestingSigner` reports available, the
 *    phone mints a Secure Enclave / StrongBox **P-256** key and registers it
 *    through the two-step challenge/verify protocol, proving both possession of
 *    the key and the integrity of the app. Reaches L4.
 *  - **Legacy, unattested.** Otherwise the single-POST `/devices` route registers
 *    the {@link HardwareSigner}'s biometric-gated Keychain **RSA** key. The server
 *    records it `unattested`, which is honest: nothing vouches for where that key
 *    lives, so it is capped at L2/L3.
 *
 * The choice is one-way. A device that CAN attest and then FAILS must not fall
 * back to the legacy path (`attestation_failed`): silently registering an
 * unattested key would leave the technician believing their phone can approve
 * critical requests when it cannot, with nothing anywhere saying otherwise.
 *
 * All functions are best-effort and FAIL OPEN with respect to LOGIN: a
 * technician with no registered device simply approves without a proof (L1).
 * They never throw and never block sign-in. Registration happens silently at
 * login using the login-minted grant, via {@link ensureApproverDevice}.
