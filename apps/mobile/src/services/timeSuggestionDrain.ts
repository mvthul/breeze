 * W06 (#3900). The offline-replay decision table for suggestion writes, kept

 * without a queue runtime.
 *
 * Why suggestion writes do NOT reuse the queue's `PERMANENT_STATUSES` parking:
 * a parked row is "real work the server refused, keep it for the technician to
 * re-enter". A rejected suggestion is not that. The window is still visible in
 * the sheet and can simply be re-offered after a refetch, so the right
 * disposition is to DROP the queued write and tell the UI what happened —
 * parking it would strand a duplicate that later re-bills the same minutes.
