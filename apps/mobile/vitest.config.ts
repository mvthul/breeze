// The timezone is pinned HERE, in the config, not in the suites that need it.

// `process.env.TZ = '...'` at the top of a test file works under the default
// forks pool and silently does NOT under `--pool=threads`: Node does not
// re-read TZ inside a worker thread, so the assignment applies to nothing and
// every local/UTC assertion runs in the runner's own zone. That made
// screens/time/timesheetLocalDays.test.ts pass locally and fail on the
// documented `--pool=threads --maxWorkers=2` invocation. Setting it before the
// config is even evaluated puts it in the environment every worker inherits.
//
// America/New_York is UTC-4 in August and UTC-5 in January, so it exercises
// both a non-zero offset and a DST change. Suites that depend on it assert the
// zone actually applied rather than trusting this line.
