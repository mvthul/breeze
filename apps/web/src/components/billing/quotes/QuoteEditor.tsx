   * rules close #3519 for every branch that routes through here — which is the
   * catch: nothing enforces that routing, so a NEW block type must call this
   * helper rather than re-inlining `positionNewBlock` + reset + `refresh()`,
   * or it reopens the bug. (Line creation had the unfixed twin of this problem;
   * it now runs the same one-shot resync-and-warn tail via `finishLineCreate`,
   * see below — #4286.)
   *
   * 1. It never throws. A throw would escape into `runScoped`'s catch and toast
   *    "Could not add the section" over a block that DOES exist — the copy that
   *    invites a re-submit, which is how four uploads became ~10 duplicate
   *    image blocks in production.
   * 2. If the canvas does not catch up, it says so. Add-block deliberately has
   *    no success toast because "the new section visibly appears" IS the
   *    signal; when the refetch fails that signal degrades to silence, and
   *    silence is what the user reads as "nothing happened".
   *
   * The form reset sits in a `finally` so a failed reposition can't leave the
   * picked file and the open insert-gap sitting there looking like work still
   * in flight.
   *
   * The resync deliberately goes through `resync()` rather than the coalescing
   * `refresh()`: adding a section is a one-shot action, not the tab-through
   * burst the throttle exists to cap, and its outcome report must not sit
   * behind a cooldown window. Worst case this costs one extra GET per add,
   * when an unrelated edit already has the window open.
