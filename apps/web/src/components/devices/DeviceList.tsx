//   poll/heartbeat. The only status the API refuses is `decommissioned`:
//   `routes/devices/commands.ts` (:89, :157, :268, :437) and the shared
//   `executeScriptOnDevices` service (`services/scriptExecution.ts:118`, which
//   drops `status === 'decommissioned'` devices from the target set and returns
//   `status:'queued'` for the rest). Running a script against an OFFLINE device

//   REMOVES that capability.
