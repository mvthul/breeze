 * Kinds whose runs can ever carry an alert severity — i.e. the only kinds for

 *
 * `runService.ts` evaluates the severity list inside
 * `evaluateAgentTriggerFilters`, which runs ONLY when the admission input
 * carries an `alertContext`, and both producers of one
 * (`alertVerdictSubscriber.ts` and `automationRuntime.ts`) admit with
 * `kind: 'triage'`. A helpdesk agent is admitted from a ticket
 * (`ticketHelpdeskSubscriber.ts`, `ticketContext`), a patch agent from a
 * manual or scheduled trigger — neither carries a severity, so the list is
 * inert for both.
 *
 * Showing the control for those kinds asked the operator to make a choice
 * that could never take effect, and the client-side `.min(1)` check could
 * block a save over a field the server never reads for that kind. Hidden AND
 * omitted from the payload: on PATCH the one-level merge preserves whatever
 * is stored, and on create the server's `aiAgentTriggersSchema` supplies its
 * own `['critical', 'high']` default, so omission is never a `.min(1)` 400.
 *
 * AI patch agent W04 (#5750): `patch` joined this set. Patch-classified
 * alerts now route to the patch agent through the same `alertContext`
 * admission path triage uses (`runService.ts`'s `evaluateAgentTriggerFilters`
 * reads `triggers.alertSeverities` whenever the admission input carries an
 * `alertContext`, and the patch-alert bridge now produces one), so the
 * severity picker is live — and meaningful — for a patch agent too.
