/**
 * The one context-switch ritual, shared by the header switcher and any inline
 * affordance (e.g. OrgRequiredState's quick-pick): set the selection (null →
 * fleet view), stash the confirmation toast, wait out any in-flight
 * /auth/refresh (#950 login-bounce race, fixed in #953/#956/#958), then
 * redirect detail routes up to their list — or re-navigate to the current
 * path — so the new scope propagates everywhere at once.
 *
 * The navigation is a SOFT one through Astro's view-transition router rather
 * than `location.reload()`: the page island is swapped and remounts under the
 * new org (every page reads the ambient org on mount, so a remount is the
 * propagation mechanism), while the shell islands marked `transition:persist`
 * — sidebar, header, AI chat, toasts — stay put. Pages do not need to
 * subscribe to the store.
 *
 * The in-place target drops the URL hash on purpose: the router treats a
 * same-path navigation that carries a hash as a scroll-to-anchor and does not
 * swap the document, and hash state (selected tab/row) is org-specific anyway.
 *
 * `destination` overrides both: for a switch that is itself a navigation ("Work
 * in this org" on the organization record hands the user their new workspace's
 * dashboard), the caller knows where the user is going and the redirect table
 * has nothing to add.
