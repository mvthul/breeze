 *
 * Without the branch, an MSP switching a toggle off in Settings → Organizations
 * → Customer Portal hands the customer a page that reads as a transient failure
 * and invites a support ticket about a switch that was deliberate (#4932). Only
 * /reports got the branch; Security, Backups, Dashboard, Devices and Equipment
 * all shipped the misleading copy, and nothing in review caught the fifth one.
 *
 * Frontmatter, not the template: the answer to a switched-off page is a 302 the
 * server returns before it renders anything, so a check written into the markup
 * would still ship the page shell. The API side is already fail-closed and
 * unit-tested (apps/api/src/routes/portal/featureFlags.test.ts) — this guards
 * the half that renders. sessionClearCoverage.test.ts is the same idea for 401s.
