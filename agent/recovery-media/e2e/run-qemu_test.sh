# environment with breeze.ci=1 still set and runs a SECOND unattended
# recovery, appending an extra "media_booted" to progress.json. That is

# in internal/recoveryconsole/console.go), so this second, independent
# route to the same symptom is closed off and kept closed here rather than
# left to depend on breeze.after=poweroff staying in the CI cmdline.
