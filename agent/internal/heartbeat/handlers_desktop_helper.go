// rejection. Without a guard here, both invocations would reach the helper, and
// SessionManager.StartSession (remote/desktop/session_webrtc.go) unconditionally
// stops EVERY existing session before registering the new one — so the second
// start tears down the first, both callers are told "completed", and only one
// peer connection is live. Worse, the first session's OnConnectionStateChange
// closure captures the session id rather than the *Session, so its late
// Closed callback calls StopSession(sessionID) and kills the SECOND session,
// firing a spurious desktop_peer_disconnected.

// The joiner takes the leader's result — "join or defer to it", as the issue
// asked. That is unconditionally right for the #3107 case, which is ONE
// start_desktop delivered over both the WebSocket and the heartbeat response:
// same command id, same offer, so the leader's answer is the joiner's answer.
//
// It is deliberately not conditioned on the offers matching. A concurrent start
// carrying a DIFFERENT offer for the same desktop session is not reachable in
// practice — the viewer retries the same offer under the same commandId
// (heartbeat.go, #434), and a genuine renegotiation only follows a completed or
// failed attempt, sequentially. Deferring such a caller to a second turn instead
// would cost real correctness: leases are keyed per desktop session
// (desktopLeaseOpID), so the leader's failure path releases the shared lease out
// from under the deferred caller, which then streams unleased and gets its
// helper reaped mid-session. A bounded wrong-SDP failure beats that, and beats
