// reference-decision comparisons.
//
// identity is this run's BackupIdentity (see BackupManager.runBackupIdentity
// / Snapshot.BackupIdentity's doc comment). A bucket can hold snapshots from
// MULTIPLE devices and run kinds with no key prefix between them (D6), so
// "the newest snapshot in the bucket" is a different question from "the
// newest snapshot for THIS device/run". previousManifest answers the
// second one: it scans ListSnapshots' results (ascending by Timestamp) from
// the newest backward and returns the first candidate whose BackupIdentity
// equals identity exactly. A candidate with any other identity — including
// a legacy manifest with no BackupIdentity at all, which never equals
// anything, empty string included — is skipped. If identity itself is
// empty (this run has no known identity — see BackupConfig.AgentID), no
// candidate can be proven to be "this run's own" snapshot, so this returns
// immediately without even listing.
//
// Returns (nil, reason) when no previous manifest is usable: no snapshot
// exists yet for this destination, every candidate belongs to a different
// identity, this run itself has no identity, or fetching/parsing failed.
// reason is always non-empty in that case so callers can log it directly.
// Dedupe is strictly an optimization — it must never fail or block a run —
// so this function never returns an error; every failure mode collapses to
// "run full" via a nil *Snapshot.

// ordinary files (appended into backupPaths) alongside everything else.
// Wave 1 of the D15 bare-metal-recovery contract (see
// docs/superpowers/plans/backup/2026-09-09-bmr-system-state-contract.md)
// moved system-state artifacts to their own remote prefix, published
// directly from the manifest by publishSystemState (snapshot.go) rather than
// discovered via the file walk — so a walked `files` slice never contains
// staging-dir entries at all anymore, and the old detector would misfire on
// EVERY run that collects any system state (markedFiles would always be 0).
// publishSystemState's own per-artifact stat/upload is a strictly stronger
// replacement: it fails loudly if an artifact the manifest describes isn't
// actually on disk, rather than inferring the mismatch indirectly from the
// file walk. Removed rather than left inert.
