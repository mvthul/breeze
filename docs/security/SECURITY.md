# Security

## SentinelOne EDR action governance

SentinelOne containment/remediation APIs are treated as high-risk operations.

### Controls

> **"MFA-assured session" / `requireMfa()`** means the session's `mfa` claim is true: the session satisfies the caller's *effective* MFA policy (organization/partner `security.requireMfa`, role `force_mfa`, or the partner-admin force flag). An account with a factor enrolled is assured only after proving it; an account with no factor under a policy that requires MFA is locked to enrollment; an account with no factor in a tenant that does **not** require MFA is admitted with a password alone, by design. `requireMfa()` is therefore not proof that a second factor was presented — operations that need a fresh proven factor regardless of tenant policy (agent rollback, maintenance entry, factor management) use the single-use step-up grant (`POST /auth/mfa/step-up`), which denies accounts with no usable factor.

- Secrets are encrypted at rest before storage (`api_token_encrypted`).
- Mutating routes require specific scopes (`organization`, `partner`, or `system`):
  - Isolation/threat-action routes require `devices:execute` permission + the MFA-assured-session middleware (`requireMfa()`).
  - Integration management routes require `organizations:write` permission + the MFA-assured-session middleware.
- AI tool tiers:
  - **Tier 1** (read-only): `get_s1_status`, `get_s1_threats` — no approval, no MFA.
  - **Tier 3** (high-risk): `s1_isolate_device`, `s1_threat_action` — approval-gated, MFA-assured session required.
  - Note: Sync is a REST-only operation (`POST /api/v1/s1/sync`), not exposed as an AI tool.
- Rate-limited: S1 AI tool invocations are limited to 5 per 10 minutes (does not apply to REST API endpoints).
- All action requests are persisted to `s1_actions` with provider action IDs for traceability.
- Action status is polled asynchronously and emitted into the event bus.
- Database tables use row-level security via `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`.

### Events

- `s1.threat_detected` — emitted during threat sync for new active threats.
- `s1.device_isolated` — emitted only when an `isolate` action completes (not unisolate).
- `s1.threat_action_completed` — emitted for completed threat remediation actions (threat_kill, threat_quarantine, threat_rollback) and unisolate.

## Huntress Incident Correlation Workflow

### Data Protection
- Huntress API keys and webhook secrets are encrypted at rest.
- Integration-scoped data is protected with tenant RLS policies on:
  - `huntress_integrations`
  - `huntress_agents`
  - `huntress_incidents`

### Ingestion Paths
- Scheduled polling (every 15 minutes, see `DEFAULT_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` in `huntressSync.ts`) through the Huntress sync worker.
- Signed webhook ingestion through `POST /api/v1/huntress/webhook`.

### Webhook Authenticity Controls
- Webhooks require HMAC-SHA256 signature validation. If `webhookSecret` is not configured on the integration, webhook ingestion is rejected with a 403 error.
- When webhook signing is enabled, signed payloads must include a timestamp header and replay window enforcement is applied (default 10 minutes).
- When webhook signing is enabled, invalid or stale signatures are rejected before persistence.
- If account-level routing is ambiguous, webhook ingestion requires an explicit integration id.

### Event Lifecycle
The integration emits normalized events on the Breeze event bus:
- `huntress.incident_created`
- `huntress.incident_updated`
- `huntress.agent_offline`

### Correlation and Triage
1. Ingest Huntress agents and incidents.
2. Correlate Huntress entities to Breeze devices by hostname matching.
3. Normalize severity and status fields.
4. Persist incident state transitions.
5. Emit integration events for downstream automation and response.

### Operational Guardrails
- Integration management and manual sync endpoints require authenticated org write access and an MFA-assured session.
- Webhook ingestion is unauthenticated by user session but cryptographically validated via HMAC-SHA256 signature.
- Integration health and incident read APIs remain org-scoped for partner/system contexts.
- The `apiBaseUrl` field is restricted to HTTPS URLs on `*.huntress.io`, and every outbound Huntress request is made through the SSRF-safe HTTP client (`safeFetch`: DNS-pinned to the resolved public IP, with no redirect following). The hostname allowlist alone is insufficient — DNS rebinding or an upstream redirect could otherwise reach an internal address — so the pinned, no-redirect transport is what actually prevents SSRF.

## Session MFA assurance source (`mfa_src`)

Since W03 of the device move-org step-up work, every `mfa: true` token also carries `mfa_src`: `factor` (Breeze verified a factor in this session's lineage), `idp` (a trusted CF Access / SSO assertion), or `policy` (the effective policy required none). Refresh and factor re-mints copy it verbatim and never upgrade it. `mfa: false` tokens carry no source at all, and tokens minted before the claim shipped have none and MUST be read as `policy`. `verifyToken` drops any value outside that set rather than typing it through. No gate consumes it yet; it exists so a future "proven factor" check is a predicate on the token, not a plumbing change. Source of truth: `apps/api/src/services/mfaAssuranceSource.ts`.
