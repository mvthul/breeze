# M365 Customer Graph Read real-tenant acceptance

Use this checklist only with a disposable, non-production Microsoft 365 tenant. It validates administrator consent, immutable tenant ownership, exact permission reconciliation, last-known grant semantics, outage behavior, and secret confinement for the `customer-graph-read` profile. It does not authorize production customer testing, Graph mutations, or external deployment changes.

## Safety and prerequisites

- A disposable Entra/Microsoft 365 tenant with no production users or data.
- One eligible test administrator holding **Global Administrator** or **Privileged Role Administrator**, and one ineligible test administrator holding neither role.
- Two non-production Breeze organizations, called Org A and Org B in this runbook. Both must be accessible to the test operator; only the intended canary IDs may be in `M365_CUSTOMER_GRAPH_READ_ONBOARDING_ORG_IDS`.
- A dedicated multitenant Customer Graph Read application and the exact manifest/version shown below. Do not reuse a legacy direct, delegated communications, mutation, or PowerShell application.
- The isolated executor deployed dark according to [the executor deployment runbook](../deploy/m365-customer-graph-read-executor.md), with private ingress, controlled egress, a dedicated Key Vault identity, and an exact scanned image digest recorded.
- A Breeze test operator with `organizations:read`, `organizations:write`, and current MFA. If operating at partner scope, the operator must also pass the partner-wide management guard.
- Read-only access to sanitized API/log/audit evidence and controlled database inspection. Do not copy secret-bearing rows or provider callback URLs into the evidence package.

Record tenant/org/user identifiers as redacted aliases plus a one-way digest. Never place raw state, cookie values, authorization codes, PKCE verifiers, nonces, tokens, private keys, certificate PEM, private JWKs, provider error bodies, or raw vault references in this document, screenshots, tickets, shell history, or attachments.

## Authoritative permission manifest

The expected profile is `customer-graph-read`, manifest version `3`, Microsoft Graph resource application `00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`, with exactly these thirteen application roles:

| Permission | App role ID |
|---|---|
| `Application.Read.All` | `9a5d68dd-52b0-4cc2-bd40-abcf44ac3a30` |
| `AuditLog.Read.All` | `b0afded3-3588-46d8-8b3d-9842eff778da` |
| `AuditLogsQuery.Read.All` | `5e1e9171-754d-478c-812c-f1755a9a4c2d` |
| `Device.Read.All` | `7438b122-aefc-4978-80ed-43db9fcc7715` |
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` | `dc377aa6-52d8-4e23-b271-2a7ae04cedf3` |
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` | `2f51be20-0bb4-4fed-bf7b-db946066c75e` |
| `Group.Read.All` | `5b567255-7703-4780-807c-7be8301ae99b` |
| `Organization.Read.All` | `498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6` |
| `Policy.Read.All` | `246dd0d5-5bd0-4def-940b-0421030a5b68` |
| `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` | `483bed4a-2ad3-4361-a73b-c83ccdbdc53c` |
| `SecurityEvents.Read.All` | `bf394140-e372-4bf9-a898-299cfc7564e5` |
| `Sites.Read.All` | `332a536c-c7ef-4017-ab91-336970924f0d` |
| `User.Read.All` | `df021288-bdef-4463-88db-98f22de89214` |

Do not use `Application.Read.All` as the ordinary missing-assignment test. Without it, Microsoft Graph may deny the authoritative assignment query, so Breeze cannot truthfully calculate a current missing set. Scenario 7 tests that distinct last-known behavior. Scenarios 6–8 must use only the approved tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` procedure below.

## Evidence key

For every scenario capture only sanitized evidence:

- **UI** — Customer Graph Read card status, stable message, tenant alias/GUID digest, manifest version, required/observed/missing/unexpected permission names, and displayed timestamps. Screenshots must not include the address bar or developer tools.
- **API** — HTTP method, route template, status, and response field names/values after redaction. Never save callback query strings or cookies.
- **DB** — connection status, `last_error_code`, manifest version, timestamps, grant names/IDs, and whether a session/attempt row exists. Query secret-bearing columns only for boolean/type/shape assertions and redact query output.
- **Audit** — fixed action name, bounded outcome, resource ID digest, attempt/correlation ID digest, result, and actor alias.
- **Metric/log** — counter delta for bounded `event`/`outcome`, correlation digest, and proof that logs contain stable codes rather than provider bodies.
- **Entra** — service-principal existence and exact assignment names/IDs. Capture the consent screen separately as described below.

Expected audit action names are `m365.customer_graph_read.consent_initiated`, `m365.customer_graph_read.admin_consent_returned`, `m365.customer_graph_read.tenant_binding_verified`, `m365.customer_graph_read.verification_failed`, `m365.customer_graph_read.grant_drift_detected`, `m365.customer_graph_read.retested`, and `m365.customer_graph_read.disconnected`. Metrics use `breeze_m365_customer_graph_read_events_total{event,outcome}`.

## Consent-screen copy capture

During the first eligible consent, capture the Microsoft screen before accepting it. Record:

- tenant alias and operator alias;
- application display name, verified publisher text, and Microsoft timestamp;
- the exact visible heading, warning, and publisher/tenant wording;
- each permission's exact Microsoft display label and explanatory sentence, transcribed verbatim into the restricted evidence record;
- a pass/fail comparison proving the screen contains exactly the thirteen manifest permission names above and no delegated or additional application permission.

Screenshots may contain tenant/test account identity but must not contain an address bar, query string, code, state, cookie, token, or developer-tools panel. Microsoft may change explanatory copy; preserve what was actually displayed rather than substituting this runbook's wording. A name/ID mismatch, omitted role, or extra role is a stop condition.

## Approved tenant-local assignment procedure for scenarios 6–8

These drift tests change only the dedicated application's service-principal assignments inside the disposable tenant. They must never change the home multitenant application registration or its published permission manifest.

Before scenario 6, an authorized Entra test operator and reviewer must:

1. Lock the active directory context to the disposable tenant and record its redacted tenant-ID digest. Stop if the current tenant is ambiguous or different.
2. Resolve the **client service principal** in that tenant by the fixed Customer Graph Read application `appId`, then verify both the resolved service-principal object ID and its exact `appId` before every write.
3. Resolve the **resource service principal** in that tenant by Microsoft Graph resource application ID `00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`, then verify its object ID and exact resource `appId` before every write.
4. Snapshot the client service principal's complete tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` set as sorted `(resourceAppId, appRoleId)` pairs. It must equal the exact thirteen-role table above before a scenario begins.
5. Snapshot and digest the home multitenant application object's published permission manifest, including `requiredResourceAccess`. Store only the approved sanitized digest/evidence reference.
6. Obtain change approval naming the one exact target `appRoleId`, whether the action is create or delete, the disposable tenant digest, the resolved client/resource service-principal object-ID digests, the rollback assignment, operator, and reviewer.

For each write, create or delete only the single target tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` whose principal is the resolved client service principal and whose resource is the resolved Microsoft Graph service principal. Do not use a generic “add/remove permission” portal action. Explicitly forbidden actions are:

- editing the home multitenant app registration or any application object;
- editing **API permissions** or `requiredResourceAccess`;
- changing the fixed application ID, certificate, redirect URI, owners, or publisher settings;
- mutating another enterprise application, another resource service principal, another tenant, or more than the one approved assignment;
- using an unscoped/bulk permission-removal command or a command that resolves tenant/object IDs implicitly.

This runbook intentionally provides no broad CLI command. Any separately approved automation must require explicit resolved object IDs and tenant context, show a no-write/dry verification of the exact principal/resource/app-role tuple, and stop unless the pre-write snapshot and home-manifest digest match the approved record.

After **each** of scenarios 6, 7, and 8, restore the disposable tenant's exact thirteen tenant-local assignments before starting the next scenario. Re-snapshot and prove:

- the sorted assignment set equals the thirteen `(resourceAppId, appRoleId)` pairs above;
- only the intended disposable-tenant assignment set changed and was restored;
- the home application manifest digest and `requiredResourceAccess` are unchanged;
- no other tenant, service principal, application object, or app-role assignment changed.

## Acceptance matrix

Run the scenarios in order. For scenarios 6–8, use only the approved tenant-local assignment procedure and restore/verify the exact thirteen assignments after each scenario.

| # | Scenario | Expected Breeze state | Expected stable error/outcome | Required evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Successful consent and tenant binding | Org A `active`; verified tenant is the disposable tenant; exact thirteen observed grants; manifest 3; both verification timestamps set | Callback `active`; `last_error_code` null | UI, safe list API, DB metadata, Entra assignments, consent copy, binding/audit/metric evidence |
| 2 | Replay both callback phases | Org A remains `active`; no connection, ownership, grant, or timestamp rollback | Each replay ends `consent_state_mismatch`; executor is not invoked | Sanitized redirect outcome, unchanged DB snapshot, failure metric/audit where an attempt is available, executor request-count delta zero |
| 3 | Expired attempt | Attempt never becomes active or binds a tenant; start a fresh attempt afterward | Callback `consent_expired` for an expired signed browser binding | Start/expiry times, sanitized redirect, no executor call, no verified tenant binding |
| 4 | Ineligible administrator | Fresh attempt remains `pending-consent`; tenant is not bound | `admin_role_required` | UI message, safe API/DB state, verification-failed audit/metric, signed-in role evidence without token/claims dump |
| 5 | Cross-org duplicate tenant/profile | Org A remains `active`; Org B is not active and cannot own the same tenant/profile | Org B callback `tenant_already_bound`; no owning-org disclosure | Both org status snapshots, generic Org B message, unique ownership DB assertion, audit/metric |
| 6 | Delete one approved ordinary tenant-local assignment (not `Application.Read.All`) | Org A becomes `degraded`; authoritative observed set and `grants_verified_at` advance; missing list names the deleted assignment | `grant_missing` | Pre/post exact assignment snapshots, unchanged home-manifest digest, Retest response, timestamps, drift/retest audit and metric |
| 7 | Delete only the tenant-local `Application.Read.All` assignment | Org A becomes `degraded`; observed grants and `grants_verified_at` remain the prior **last-known** values; `last_verified_at` may advance for the bounded tenant probe | `grant_reconciliation_unavailable`, not `grant_missing` | UI “Last-known” label, assignment snapshots, unchanged home-manifest digest, DB digests/timestamps, retest audit/metric |
| 8 | Create one pre-approved unexpected tenant-local assignment | Org A becomes `degraded`; complete observed set contains the extra role and `grants_verified_at` advances | `grant_unexpected` | Pre/post assignment snapshots, unchanged home-manifest digest, UI/API unexpected group, DB metadata, drift/retest audit and metric |
| 9 | Re-consent restores exact grants | Org A returns `active`; observed equals the exact thirteen; timestamps advance | Callback `active`; `last_error_code` null | Consent, UI/API/DB exact equality, binding/retest audit as applicable |
| 10 | Remove tenant-wide Microsoft consent and detect with Retest | Org A becomes `degraded`; prior observed grants and verification timestamp are retained, and no new Microsoft consent is inferred | `application_token_invalid` | Enterprise-app removal evidence, Retest result, unchanged last-known grant digest, retest audit/metric |
| 11 | Executor outage and recovery | During outage an existing `active` row stays `active`; after recovery a successful Retest is `active` | During outage `executor_unavailable`; after recovery null | Health/reachability evidence, pre/outage/recovery DB state, executor request/metric evidence |
| 12 | Local disconnect and delayed-result rejection | Org A becomes `revoked`; tenant/client/display/grant/verification execution state is cleared; consent attempt rotates; Microsoft consent remains until separately removed | Disconnect outcome `revoked`; delayed callback `consent_state_mismatch` or delayed scoped mutation `404 Connection not found` | UI/API/DB, disconnected audit/metric, unchanged Entra consent before separate removal, delayed-result rejection |
| 13 | Separate Microsoft consent removal and cleanup | Breeze remains `revoked`; disposable Entra service principal/consent and test artifacts are removed | No Breeze claim that local disconnect removed Microsoft consent | Entra removal confirmation, final safe DB/audit retention check, cleanup sign-off |

## Scenario procedure and assertions

### 1. Successful consent and immutable tenant binding

1. Select Org A at **Integrations → Identity → Microsoft 365**. Confirm the legacy direct card remains separate and unchanged.
2. On the Customer Graph Read card, verify all thirteen required permissions are rendered from the API manifest and no tenant/client/secret/certificate field is editable.
3. Choose **Connect**, complete current MFA, sign in as the eligible administrator, capture consent-screen copy, and accept.
4. Complete the administrator identity step. Confirm the terminal browser location is `/integrations#m365/customer-graph-read/active` and the card refreshes.
5. Verify status `active`, manifest version 3, the signed tenant GUID, organization display name, exact observed assignments, `last_verified_at`, and `grants_verified_at`.
6. Verify `tenant_binding_verified` has outcome `active`; audit details contain only the fixed profile, attempt/correlation identifiers, manifest version, bounded outcome, and verified tenant after proof.

### 2. Replay both callback phases

Use browser Back/Reload or a controlled test proxy that keeps sensitive query values only in memory. Do not save callback URLs, HAR files, request headers, or clipboard contents.

1. Replay the admin-consent callback after it has transitioned to identity verification.
2. Replay the identity callback after its terminal single-use consumption.
3. Confirm each ends at the `consent_state_mismatch` hash, clears the binding cookie on the terminal path, and makes no executor request.
4. Confirm Org A remains active with the same tenant ownership, grants, and verified timestamps.

### 3. Expired attempt

1. Start a fresh attempt and do not submit its Microsoft callback for more than ten minutes.
2. Resume using only the original browser session; do not copy the callback URL.
3. Confirm an expired valid binding redirects to `consent_expired` before state lookup, does not call the executor, and does not bind a tenant.
4. Start a new attempt for subsequent scenarios.

### 4. Ineligible administrator

1. Start fresh consent and complete both Microsoft steps using the ineligible administrator.
2. Confirm `admin_role_required`, `pending-consent`, and no verified tenant binding.
3. Confirm neither ID-token claims nor administrator object ID appears in UI, safe API, audit, or logs.

### 5. Duplicate ownership across Breeze organizations

1. Restore/confirm Org A is active for the disposable tenant.
2. Enable onboarding for Org B and attempt consent to the same tenant/profile with the eligible administrator.
3. Confirm `tenant_already_bound`, that the response does not identify Org A, and that only Org A owns the verified `(tenant_id, customer-graph-read)` pair.

### 6. Missing ordinary grant

1. Complete the approved tenant-local procedure's tenant, client service-principal, Microsoft Graph resource service-principal, exact-thirteen assignment snapshot, home-manifest digest, and reviewer checks.
2. Delete only the approved target tenant-local `appRoleAssignment`, selected by its exact assignment object and `appRoleId`. The target must be one of the thirteen roles other than `Application.Read.All`.
3. Choose **Retest**. Confirm `degraded`, `grant_missing`, the removed grant in the missing group, an authoritative updated observed set, and a newer `grants_verified_at`.
4. Recreate only that same tenant-local assignment using the previously verified client principal, Microsoft Graph resource principal, and app-role ID.
5. Confirm the tenant-local set is exactly thirteen again, the home manifest/`requiredResourceAccess` digest is unchanged, and no other object or tenant changed before continuing.

### 7. Reconciliation unavailable after `Application.Read.All` removal

1. Return Org A to active, repeat the approved tenant-local pre-write resolution/snapshot checks, and record the observed-grant digest plus `grants_verified_at`.
2. Delete only the tenant-local `Application.Read.All` `appRoleAssignment` with app-role ID `9a5d68dd-52b0-4cc2-bd40-abcf44ac3a30`, then choose **Retest**.
3. Confirm `degraded` and `grant_reconciliation_unavailable`. The UI must say **Last-known observed permissions**.
4. Confirm Breeze did not overwrite observed grants, did not advance `grants_verified_at`, and did not report `Application.Read.All` as an authoritative current `grant_missing` result. A successful bounded organization probe may advance `last_verified_at`.
5. Recreate only that same tenant-local assignment, verify the exact thirteen-role set is restored, verify the home manifest/`requiredResourceAccess` digest is unchanged, and confirm no other object or tenant changed before continuing.

### 8. Unexpected drift

1. Repeat the approved tenant-local pre-write resolution/snapshot checks. The reviewer must approve one exact read-only Microsoft Graph `appRoleId` outside the thirteen-role manifest and its rollback before any write.
2. Create only that one tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` from the resolved client service principal to the resolved Microsoft Graph resource service principal. Do not edit API permissions, an application object, or `requiredResourceAccess`.
3. Choose **Retest**. Confirm `degraded`, `grant_unexpected`, complete observed grants, and the extra role in the unexpected alert.
4. Confirm both `retested` and `grant_drift_detected` use the bounded `grant_unexpected` outcome.
5. Delete only the created tenant-local assignment. Verify the exact thirteen-role set is restored, the home manifest/`requiredResourceAccess` digest is unchanged, and no other object or tenant changed before continuing.

### 9. Re-consent recovery

1. Confirm Entra is configured with exactly the thirteen manifest roles.
2. Choose **Re-consent** and complete both Microsoft steps with the eligible administrator.
3. Confirm `active`, no stable error, exact observed equality, and newer authoritative verification timestamps.

### 10. Microsoft tenant-wide consent removal detected by Retest

1. Record active status and the last-known grant/timestamp digests.
2. In Entra **Enterprise applications**, remove the tenant's service principal/tenant-wide consent for the dedicated Customer Graph Read application. Do not use **Disconnect from Breeze** yet.
3. Choose **Retest**. Confirm `degraded` with `application_token_invalid`; Breeze must not claim success from prior metadata.
4. Confirm the last-known observed set is not replaced by an empty fabricated set and no grant verification timestamp advances.
5. Recreate consent with **Re-consent** before scenario 11.

### 11. Executor outage and recovery

1. With Org A active, make only the private executor unavailable to the API. Do not change Entra consent or database state.
2. Choose **Retest**. Confirm the request records `executor_unavailable` while preserving status `active`, tenant binding, observed grants, and verification timestamps.
3. Restore the same approved exact-digest deployment and matching pinned credential configuration.
4. Confirm private `/healthz`, then choose **Retest**. Confirm `active` and a successful authoritative timestamp advance.

### 12. Local disconnect and delayed result rejection

1. Start a fresh consent attempt and retain only an in-memory ability to release its delayed callback/result; do not store its sensitive values.
2. Choose **Disconnect from Breeze** and accept the warning.
3. Confirm status `revoked`; consent sessions are removed; the attempt ID rotates; tenant/client/display/grants/verification execution fields are cleared; audit history remains.
4. Confirm the Entra service principal/consent still exists. Local disconnect is not Microsoft consent removal.
5. Release the delayed callback/result. Confirm it cannot revive or bind the connection: callback outcome is `consent_state_mismatch`, or a scoped delayed mutation receives `404` with `Connection not found`.

### 13. Separate Microsoft removal and cleanup

1. Follow the public [Microsoft consent removal instructions](../../apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/identity-integrations.mdx#remove-customer-graph-read-consent) using the disposable tenant's Entra **Enterprise applications** entry.
2. Confirm the service principal and tenant-wide application consent are gone. Do not remove `Application.Read.All` from an unrelated app or alter a production tenant.
3. Leave the Breeze connection `revoked` so audit evidence remains, unless the approved test-data retention procedure requires broader cleanup.
4. Remove Org A/Org B from the onboarding allowlist, restore dark mode if no other canary is approved, delete temporary test users/roles, delete disposable screenshots from local machines, and revoke temporary operator access.
5. Retain only the sanitized evidence package and change record required by policy.

## Secret non-observation review

Run this review after scenarios 1, 9, 11, and 12. Record only pass/fail, query/review method, reviewer, time, and redacted artifact digest.

| Surface | Required assertion |
|---|---|
| Browser | After terminal redirect, the current URL, DOM, React state, local storage, and session storage contain no state, cookie, authorization code, PKCE verifier, nonce, token, private key/certificate, private JWK, or vault reference. Do not persist network captures used during the protocol. |
| Safe API responses | `GET /m365/connections?orgId=...`, consent initiation, Retest, and Disconnect responses contain only their strict DTOs. They contain no client secret, token, certificate, private JWK, state/cookie, authorization code, verifier/nonce, provider body, administrator object ID, credential version, or vault reference. |
| Database | Connection rows contain no client secret for `customer-graph-read`, token, certificate/private key, private JWK, authorization code, PKCE verifier, or nonce. Completed/disconnected attempt sessions are absent. The connection's code-designed `vault_ref` is an opaque version-pinned locator and `credential_version` is metadata; inspect them only through a redacted shape/version assertion and never copy their raw values into evidence. |
| Audit | Details contain only profile, attempt ID, manifest version, outcome, correlation ID, and verified tenant after proof. No state/cookie, code, verifier/nonce, token, certificate/private key, private JWK, raw provider body, administrator object ID, or vault locator appears. |
| API/executor logs | Search the bounded test window for known canary markers and sensitive field names. Logs contain stable error codes/correlation IDs only, not values or provider bodies. Do not search by printing real secret values into the command or evidence. |
| Executor/runtime | Image history/config contains no credential material. Only the executor identity can read the pinned Key Vault version; the API/web/general worker identities receive access denied. Executor responses never include Microsoft tokens or certificate material. |

The database exception above is intentional and must not be hidden: the design stores an opaque version-pinned `vault_ref` and version on the connection, and temporarily stores nonce/verifier only in a system-only one-time consent session. Acceptance requires the session to be consumed/deleted and the raw locator to remain confined to database/configuration boundaries, not a false assertion that these designed fields never exist.

## Scenarios 6–8 drift-safety reviewer assertion

The reviewer must mark every item pass before accepting scenarios 6–8:

- [ ] The write was locked to the disposable tenant's explicit directory context.
- [ ] The client service principal was resolved by and rechecked against the fixed Customer Graph Read `appId`.
- [ ] The resource service principal was resolved by and rechecked against Microsoft Graph resource application ID `00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`.
- [ ] The exact target `appRoleId`, create/delete direction, resolved principal/resource object IDs, and rollback were approved before the write.
- [ ] The complete tenant-local assignment set was snapshotted and equaled the exact thirteen roles before the scenario.
- [ ] Only one target tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` was created or deleted; no generic permission operation was used.
- [ ] The home multitenant app registration, API permissions, application object, and `requiredResourceAccess` were not edited.
- [ ] The home application manifest digest was unchanged and evidence proves only the disposable tenant assignment set changed.
- [ ] The exact thirteen tenant-local assignments were restored and verified after each scenario, before the next scenario and before cleanup.
- [ ] No unscoped/bulk CLI command or implicit tenant/object resolution was used.

## Read-action acceptance

Use this section only after scenario 1 (successful consent and tenant binding) is accepted and Org A is `active` against the disposable tenant. It validates the twelve typed Microsoft Graph read actions exposed by the six `m365_query_*` AI tools, executed through `POST /v1/read-action` on the same isolated executor. It is independent of, and does not replace, scenarios 1–13: those validate connection lifecycle; this validates per-call read behavior, projection, permission/licensing drift, and budget enforcement. It carries the same safety rules as the rest of this runbook — disposable tenant only, redacted evidence only, no raw Graph payload in any artifact.

### Prerequisites

- Org A `active` on the `customer-graph-read` profile (scenario 1 complete).
- `M365_GRAPH_READ_TOOLS_ENABLED=true` on every API instance, with Org A's canonical UUID present in `M365_GRAPH_READ_TOOLS_ORG_IDS` (or `*`). This flag is independent of `M365_CUSTOMER_GRAPH_READ_ONBOARDING_ENABLED` — confirm it separately rather than assuming onboarding being enabled implies it.
- An AI chat session scoped to Org A that is not site-restricted (a site-scoped session is refused with `site_scope_denied` before any tool call reaches the connection).
- The same approved tenant-local `appRoleAssignment` procedure, reviewer, and restore discipline used for scenarios 6–8.

### Acceptance matrix

| # | Scenario | Expected Breeze state | Expected stable error/outcome | Required evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Execute all twelve read actions once via the six AI tools | Org A remains `active`; every returned item/resource contains only its action's allowlisted fields | `ok` for all twelve actions | Redacted tool transcripts, per-action field diff against the projection allowlist, audit rows, metric deltas |
| R2 | Remove `AuditLog.Read.All` via the approved tenant-local procedure, then call all six tools | Org A `degraded` (consistent with scenario 6); the five tools not requiring `AuditLog.Read.All` keep succeeding while degraded | `m365_query_signins` → `graph_permission_missing` with the Retest hint; the other five tools → `ok` | Pre/post assignment snapshots, tool responses for both outcomes, audit rows, unchanged home-manifest digest |
| R3 | Call `m365_query_signins` against a disposable tenant/organization without Entra ID P1/P2 | Connection status and observed grants unchanged | `graph_license_required`, message references the Entra ID P1/P2 requirement, no Retest hint | Tool response, audit row, confirmation the tenant lacks the premium SKU |
| R4 | Issue 31 rapid `m365_query_users` calls within one minute | Org A unaffected; the first 30 calls execute normally | Call 31 → `read_rate_limited` with a positive `retryAfterSeconds`; the limited call writes no audit/metric row | Ordered call log with outcomes, the returned `retryAfterSeconds` value, metric deltas covering only the 30 successful calls |
| R5 | Cross-check audit and metric evidence for R1–R4 | — | — | Exactly one `m365.customer_graph_read.action_executed` audit row per executed attempt, fields limited to `actionType`/`outcome`/`itemCount`/`truncated`; `breeze_m365_graph_read_actions_total{action,outcome}` deltas match the audit counts exactly |

### R1. Execute every typed read action

1. Confirm Org A's status (`active` or `degraded` from a prior main-flow scenario) and that `M365_GRAPH_READ_TOOLS_ENABLED`/`M365_GRAPH_READ_TOOLS_ORG_IDS` cover Org A.
2. In an AI chat session scoped to Org A, call each tool at least once so that all twelve action IDs execute:
   - `m365_query_users` — list and get modes (`m365.user.list`, `m365.user.get`)
   - `m365_query_signins` — (`m365.signins.list`)
   - `m365_query_intune_devices` — list and get modes, get mode takes `intuneDeviceId` (`m365.intune.device.list`, `m365.intune.device.get`)
   - `m365_query_groups` — list, get, and members modes (`m365.group.list`, `m365.group.get`, `m365.group.members.list`)
   - `m365_query_org` — org and SKU modes (`m365.org.get`, `m365.org.skus.list`)
   - `m365_query_sites` — list and get modes (`m365.sites.list`, `m365.site.get`)
3. For each response, diff its field set against that action's fixed projection allowlist. Confirm no additional Graph field, nested object, or raw payload beyond the allowlisted fields is present.
4. Confirm each call recorded exactly one `m365.customer_graph_read.action_executed` audit row with `outcome: 'ok'` and a plausible `itemCount`, and incremented `breeze_m365_graph_read_actions_total{action="<id>",outcome="ok"}` by one.

### R2. Permission drift: sign-in reads degrade in isolation

1. Repeat the approved tenant-local pre-write resolution/snapshot checks used for scenarios 6–8.
2. Delete only the tenant-local `AuditLog.Read.All` `appRoleAssignment` (app role ID `b0afded3-3588-46d8-8b3d-9842eff778da`).
3. Choose **Retest**. Confirm the connection is `degraded` with `grant_missing`, consistent with scenario 6.
4. Call `m365_query_signins`. Confirm it returns `graph_permission_missing` with the "run Retest on the Microsoft 365 card" guidance.
5. Call the remaining five tools. Confirm each still returns `ok` while the connection is `degraded` — reads execute in both `active` and `degraded` states, and one action's missing grant does not block unrelated actions.
6. Recreate only that same tenant-local assignment, verify the exact thirteen-role set is restored, verify the home manifest/`requiredResourceAccess` digest is unchanged, and confirm no other object or tenant changed before continuing.

### R3. Non-premium tenant: sign-in reads require Entra ID P1/P2

1. Using a disposable tenant/organization without an Entra ID P1 or P2 license assigned, call `m365_query_signins`.
2. Confirm the outcome is `graph_license_required` and the surfaced message references the Entra ID P1/P2 requirement for sign-in logs — not a consent or grant problem, and distinct from `graph_permission_missing` in R2.
3. Confirm the connection status and observed grants are unchanged and no Retest-style remediation prompt is shown; this is a licensing fact about the tenant, not a drift event.

### R4. Budget enforcement

1. With Org A `active`, issue 31 `m365_query_users` calls in rapid succession within the same 60-second window, against the same connection.
2. Confirm the first 30 calls execute normally, each writing one audit row and one metric increment with `outcome: 'ok'`.
3. Confirm the 31st call is refused with `read_rate_limited` and a positive `retryAfterSeconds`, and that it writes **no** audit row or metric increment — the budget check runs before the executor call, so a denied call leaves no per-action trace beyond the Redis counter itself.
4. Wait past the reported `retryAfterSeconds` and confirm a subsequent call succeeds again.
5. Confirm the day budget (2,000 actions/connection/day) by log/metric review rather than issuing 2,000 live calls against the disposable tenant.

### R5. Audit and metric cross-check

1. For every call made in R1–R4, confirm exactly one `m365.customer_graph_read.action_executed` audit row exists per executed attempt (rate-limited refusals excluded, per R4), with `details` limited to `actionType`, `outcome`, `itemCount`, and `truncated`.
2. Confirm no audit row contains a Graph item, field value, or raw payload — only the four allowlisted metadata fields.
3. Confirm `breeze_m365_graph_read_actions_total{action,outcome}` counter deltas for the acceptance window match the audit row counts exactly, action-by-action and outcome-by-outcome.

Any read action returning a field outside its projection allowlist, any audit/metric row carrying Graph payload content, or any budget/permission/licensing outcome that does not match the table above is a failed run. Treat it the same as a failed scenario 1–13 run: disable the tools flag and preserve only sanitized evidence while the issue is investigated.

## Tenant-sync acceptance

Run after the read-action acceptance passes, on a real customer tenant with an
administrator available. Sync is gated by `M365_TENANT_SYNC_ENABLED`; turn it
on for the acceptance window and record the flag state in the evidence record.

### Prerequisites

- `M365_TENANT_SYNC_ENABLED=true` on the API under test.
- The read app registration carries all four manifest-v3 roles
  (`Policy.Read.All`, `RoleManagement.Read.Directory`,
  `SecurityEvents.Read.All`, `AuditLogsQuery.Read.All`).
- Two tenants: one with Entra ID P1 or higher, one **without** (scenario S5).
- One directory role assigned through a **role-assignable group** rather than
  directly to a user (scenario S6). Create it as: a role-assignable security
  group → add one member → assign the group a directory role.
- `psql` access to the API's database as an administrator for the row
  assertions, and the Prometheus scrape URL for the metric assertions.
- Scenario **S7** needs none of the above — it measures the executor's memory
  ceiling against a fake Graph and can be run before any tenant is available.

### Acceptance matrix

| # | Scenario | Must be true |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | v3 consent on a fresh tenant | Six sync-state rows seeded, all six domains complete within one cadence window |
| S2 | Upgrade-consent on an existing v2 connection | Reads and sync never stop; manifest promotes in place; `consent_generation` increments |
| S3 | First sync populates every domain | Rows in all seven tables; rollup row for today with `domains_fresh` complete for all six |
| S4 | On-demand sync | Five non-sign-in domains re-run at priority 1; a second call within 15 minutes is refused |
| S5 | Non-P1 tenant | `sources.signInActivity = "unlicensed"`, domain status `success`, interval at its maximum, UI says sign-in needs Entra ID P1 |
| S6 | Role via a role-assignable group | The member's `admin_roles` entry carries `viaGroupId`; `is_admin` is true |
| S7 | Executor memory ceiling | Peak RSS under four concurrent 25 000-user snapshots is measured, and the deploy doc's memory-table cell is filled with it |

### S1. v3 consent on a fresh tenant

1. Connect a tenant that has never consented, approving the v3 manifest.
2. Assert six state rows exist and are due immediately:

```sql
SELECT domain, next_sync_at, interval_seconds, last_status
FROM m365_sync_state WHERE org_id = '<org>' ORDER BY domain;
```

3. Wait one ticker interval. Every row reaches `last_status = 'success'` (or
   `'partial'` with a recorded `sources` entry explaining which secondary
   source failed) and a non-null `last_complete_snapshot_at`.
4. Assert the first Secure Score run backfilled history:

```sql
SELECT count(*), min(score_date), max(score_date)
FROM m365_secure_score_snapshots WHERE org_id = '<org>';
```

   Expect up to 90 rows, dated by Graph's `createdDateTime` — the oldest row's
   date must be roughly 90 days before today, **not** today.

### S2. Upgrade-consent on an existing v2 connection

1. Start from a connection at `permission_manifest_version = 2`, status
   `active`. The card shows the amber "New Microsoft 365 permissions are
   required" banner.
2. Before approving, run an AI read tool and confirm it still answers, and
   confirm a `skus` sync run still completes. **Reads and sync must not stop
   while the upgrade is pending.**
3. Click **Approve new permissions** and complete the Microsoft flow.
4. Assert in-place promotion — the connection id does not change:

```sql
SELECT id, status, permission_manifest_version, consent_generation
FROM m365_connections WHERE org_id = '<org>' AND profile = 'customer-graph-read';
```

   `permission_manifest_version` is 3, `consent_generation` incremented by
   one, `status` still `active`, `id` unchanged from step 1.
5. Repeat with an **abandoned** flow: start the upgrade, close the Microsoft
   tab without approving, wait five minutes. The connection stays `active` at
   version 2 with `last_error_code` null, and reads keep working.

### S3. First sync populates every domain

```sql
SELECT 'users' AS t, count(*) FROM m365_users WHERE org_id = '<org>'
UNION ALL SELECT 'devices', count(*) FROM m365_intune_devices WHERE org_id = '<org>'
UNION ALL SELECT 'ca', count(*) FROM m365_ca_policies WHERE org_id = '<org>'
UNION ALL SELECT 'skus', count(*) FROM m365_license_skus WHERE org_id = '<org>'
UNION ALL SELECT 'scores', count(*) FROM m365_secure_score_snapshots WHERE org_id = '<org>'
UNION ALL SELECT 'rollups', count(*) FROM m365_posture_rollups WHERE org_id = '<org>';

SELECT domains_fresh FROM m365_posture_rollups
WHERE org_id = '<org>' AND rollup_date = current_date;
```

Every domain key in `domains_fresh` carries `"complete": true` and an `asOf`
within the cadence window. Cross-check counts against the Microsoft 365 admin
centre: user count, licensed seat count, and Intune device count must match
within the enrolment lag. Confirm the card's "Last synced" line agrees.

Then re-run the same domain and confirm the change-only contract holds. Note
`last_counts` carries the snake_case **rollup** column names
(`users_total`, `users_enabled`, …), not a per-run inserted/updated/unchanged
tally — that tally is internal to the run and isn't persisted, so the durable
check is that no row actually changed:

```sql
-- Snapshot before the re-run.
SELECT graph_id, last_changed_at FROM m365_users WHERE org_id = '<org>' ORDER BY graph_id;
-- … trigger the domain's next sync, wait for it to complete …
-- Re-run the same query. On an unchanged tenant every last_changed_at is
-- identical to the snapshot; a domain that touches unchanged rows anyway
-- is the §5.4 "change-only writes" contract regressing.
SELECT last_status, last_counts FROM m365_sync_state WHERE org_id = '<org>' AND domain = 'users';
```

`last_status` is `success` and `last_counts.users_total` matches the tenant's
current user count either way — that alone does not prove nothing was
written; the `last_changed_at` comparison above is what does.

### S4. On-demand sync

1. Press the on-demand sync control (MFA-gated, like Retest).
2. Assert the five non-sign-in domains got `next_sync_at = now()` and were
   claimed at priority 1; `signin_activity` is untouched (it is app-wide
   budgeted and deliberately excluded).
3. Press it again immediately: it is refused by the per-org 15-minute Redis
   limit, with a message saying when it can be retried.

### S5. Non-P1 tenant: sign-in activity is unlicensed, not broken

```sql
SELECT last_status, sources, interval_seconds
FROM m365_sync_state WHERE org_id = '<non-p1-org>' AND domain = 'signin_activity';
```

`sources ->> 'signInActivity'` is `unlicensed`, `last_status` is `success`
(not `error`), and `interval_seconds` has been stretched to its maximum
(604800). No other domain is affected. The UI shows "Sign-in activity needs
Entra ID P1", never a blank or a zero.

### S6. Role assigned through a role-assignable group

```sql
SELECT user_principal_name, is_admin, admin_roles
FROM m365_users WHERE org_id = '<org>' AND is_admin;
```

The group member appears with `is_admin = true` and an `admin_roles` entry
carrying `viaGroupId` set to the group's object id. Nested groups are **not**
followed by design; a member of a group nested inside the role-assignable
group must not appear. Record both observations.

### S7. Executor memory ceiling under four concurrent maximum-size snapshots

The one scenario here that needs **no customer tenant**: it measures the
executor, not Microsoft. Run it before the first canary, because the memory
table in `docs/deploy/m365-customer-graph-read-executor.md` has a cell that
must hold a measured number rather than a guess, and a 25 000-seat tenant is
not something an acceptance window can conjure on demand. The ceiling is a
function of the item cap and the in-flight cap, not of who the users are.

1. Build and start the executor on its own, with the sync cap at its
   default, autostart on (the process otherwise stays up without listening),
   and a container limit high enough that the limit is not what you are
   measuring:

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/m365-graph-read-executor build
M365_GRAPH_READ_EXECUTOR_AUTOSTART=1 M365_SYNC_MAX_IN_FLIGHT=4 M365_SYNC_MAX_ITEMS_USERS=25000 \
  node apps/m365-graph-read-executor/dist/index.cjs &
EXECUTOR_PID=$!
```

2. Point its Graph base URL at a local server that serves 25 000
   **Microsoft-Graph-shaped** `/users` page responses per pull — the raw
   `{"value": [{"id": …, "userPrincipalName": …, …}], "@odata.nextLink": …}`
   shape the executor's own Graph client consumes, not the executor's
   projected `M365SyncActionResult` output (`syncUsersResult` in
   `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/m365SyncFakeExecutor.ts` builds THAT
   shape — the wrong layer for this scenario, which stubs Microsoft, not the
   executor). Generate the 25 000-user page once and serve the same body to
   every call.
3. Issue four `m365.sync.users` calls concurrently (against the EXECUTOR's
   `/v1/sync-action`, signed the same way `m365SyncFakeExecutor.ts` signs its
   test requests) and sample RSS throughout:

```bash
( while kill -0 "$EXECUTOR_PID" 2>/dev/null; do ps -o rss= -p "$EXECUTOR_PID"; sleep 0.25; done ) \
  | sort -n | tail -1     # peak RSS in kilobytes
```

4. Convert the peak to MiB and write it into the "4 × 25 000 users" row of the
   memory table in `docs/deploy/m365-customer-graph-read-executor.md`, then set
   the container limit to at least 1.5× that figure.
5. Repeat once with `M365_SYNC_MAX_IN_FLIGHT=1`. The peak should scale roughly
   linearly with the in-flight cap. If it does not, a snapshot is being
   retained after its response is written — that is a leak to fix, not a sizing
   number to record.

### Evidence to record

For each scenario: date, tenant display name (never the tenant id), operator,
the SQL output, the card screenshot where the scenario has a UI assertion, and
the values of `m365_sync_ticker_utilisation` and `m365_sync_due_backlog` at the
end of the window. Add the block to the evidence record template above.
