# Wave 01 — API: server-chosen base, pins, leases, retirements, storage identity, lineage — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give the server a durable, lease-fenced pin on the incremental-dedupe base it hands the agent, a durable retirement tombstone for every row retention deletes, a per-job/per-snapshot storage identity stamped at dispatch, full lineage (parent/incremental/late-result) plumbing, and a transaction-boundary fix so retention's retirements commit per row instead of inside one giant ambient transaction — the data-model half of D18. The GC sweep rewrite (§3.4) and the agent (§3.5) are W02/W03.

**Architecture:** `backup_jobs` gains `base_snapshot_id`, `publish_lease_expires_at` (set for every dispatched file/system_image job, fixed at dispatch, never renewed), and `storage_identity` (stamped at dispatch from the payload's `providerConfig`). `backup_snapshots` gains a nullable `storage_identity`, copied from the job at publication. A new `backup_snapshot_retirements` table is the durable tombstone retention writes instead of a bare delete. Dispatch acquires the base pin in a job→snapshot lock-ordered transaction; retention is restructured so each candidate row commits in its own system-DB context instead of sharing the worker's blanket transaction (§3.7); a new reaper rule fails commandless pending restores after 1h; lineage fields are threaded through both live results and reconcile-adopted manifests, gated by a late-result fence.

**Tech Stack:** Hono + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (RLS), Vitest (unit + `vitest.integration.config.ts`), zod.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/backup/2026-09-09-backup-gc-reclamation-design.md` v3 (§3.1 base pin/lease, §3.2 retention pin checks, §3.3 retirements table, §3.6 storage identity, §3.7 transaction boundaries, §4 migrations/registries — NOT §3.4 sweep rules or §3.5 agent-side, which are W02/W03).

**Depends on:** none (first wave). W02 (GC sweep rewrite) and W03 (agent) depend on this wave's schema + `backupGcKnobs.ts`.

## Global Constraints

- Migration files (next free slot after shipped `2026-10-15-140004`, confirmed via `ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1`):
  - `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160201-backup-jobs-base-pin-and-storage-identity.sql`
  - `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160202-backup-snapshot-retirements.sql`
- New columns: `backup_jobs.base_snapshot_id varchar(255)` NULL, `backup_jobs.publish_lease_expires_at timestamptz` NULL (set for **every** dispatched file/system_image job, base or not; fixed at dispatch — never renewed on progress), `backup_jobs.storage_identity text` NULL (stamped at dispatch), `backup_snapshots.storage_identity text` NULL (**forever** nullable — no follow-up `SET NOT NULL` migration; self-healing is W02's sweep job).
- New table: `backup_snapshot_retirements` (columns per spec §3.3, shape-1 RLS, unique `(storage_identity, snapshot_id)`).
- New env knobs, all resolved **per call** (never module-load-cached) via one shared `resolveMsKnob` helper in new file `apps/api/src/services/backupGcKnobs.ts`:
  - `BACKUP_BASE_LEASE_MS` — default 7 d (`604_800_000`), production floor 1 h.
  - `BACKUP_RESTORE_PIN_LINGER_MS` — default 7 d, production floor 1 h.
  - `BACKUP_PUBLISH_MARGIN_MS` — default 1 h (`3_600_000`), production floor 5 min.
- `normalizeStorageIdentity(provider, providerConfig)` (exported, `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:661`) is the ONE identity function for live TypeScript code paths. Migration `160201` does NOT replicate it in SQL and does not backfill `backup_snapshots.storage_identity` at all (coordinator decision, spec §3.6/§4 amended) — every row starts NULL and is self-healed later by the W02 GC sweep from a live bucket listing.
- Registries to touch: `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts` (`CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`), `apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts` (`CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES`, `CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES`), `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` (`CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`). `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` needs NO new allowlist entry (shape 1 = plain `org_id` column = auto-discovered).
- Lock order for the base pin is **job, then snapshot** (mirrors `routes/devices/moveOrg.ts:248-253`'s "lock parents in a fixed order as the transaction's first statements" pattern).

## 0. Ground truth

All of the below was verified directly against the worktree at `/Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/backup-gc-5429` on 2026-09-09; every citation was re-opened, not copied from the spec.

- `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts:207-278` (`backupJobs`) — no `baseSnapshotId`/`publishLeaseExpiresAt`/`storageIdentity` columns exist yet. `:247` `snapshotId varchar(BACKUP_SNAPSHOT_ID_MAX_LENGTH)`.
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts:280-337` (`backupSnapshots`) — `:300` `isIncremental boolean default(false)` and `:305-308` `parentSnapshotId` self-FK `ON DELETE SET NULL` already exist (D17, migration `2026-10-15-140004`) and are never written by the live write path. No `storageIdentity` column yet.
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts:330-332` — `snapshotIdIdx: index('backup_snapshots_snapshot_id_idx').on(table.snapshotId)` is a PLAIN, NON-UNIQUE index — `backup_snapshots.snapshot_id` (the agent-supplied string) carries no uniqueness constraint of any kind at the DB level. Review fix implication: every lookup in this plan that matches a row by a bare `snapshotId` string (dispatch's base-candidate re-check, retention's backup-pin check, the late-result fence's base lookup, reconcile's base-existence check) must ALSO be scoped by `storageIdentity`, or it is not guaranteed to identify one specific row.
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts:62` — `IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES = ['pending', 'running'] as const`, exported from this module.
- `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-140004-backup-snapshot-lineage-fk-set-null.sql` (full file read) — the newest shipped migration; confirmed via `ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1` that no later-sorting file exists, so `160201`/`160202` are free, correctly-ordered slots.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:661-672` — `normalizeStorageIdentity` verbatim:
  ```ts
  export function normalizeStorageIdentity(provider: string, providerConfig: Record<string, unknown>): string {
    if (provider === 'local') {
      const rawPath = getStringValue(providerConfig, 'path') || getStringValue(providerConfig, 'basePath') || '';
      const normalizedPath = rawPath ? resolveLocalPath(rawPath) : '';
      return `local::${normalizedPath}`;
    }
    const endpoint = normalizeS3Endpoint(getStringValue(providerConfig, 'endpoint'));
    const bucket = (getStringValue(providerConfig, 'bucket') || getStringValue(providerConfig, 'bucketName') || '').trim();
    return `${provider}::${endpoint}::${bucket}`;
  }
  ```
  `resolveLocalPath = require('node:path').resolve` (import at `:9`) — resolves relative to the **calling process's cwd**. `normalizeS3Endpoint` (`:631-642`) strips scheme, lowercases the host, canonicalizes a blank endpoint and AWS's own default endpoints (`DEFAULT_AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_PATTERN`, `:617`, `/^s3(\.dualstack)?([.-][a-z0-9-]+)?\.amazonaws\.com$/`) to `''`, and keeps `host:port` when a port is present. Bucket names are trimmed but never lowercased (case-sensitive per S3 spec).
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:494-539` — `BACKUP_GC_GRACE_MS` is resolved via `resolveBackupGcGraceMs()` but frozen at module load (`export const BACKUP_GC_GRACE_MS = resolveBackupGcGraceMs();`) — the defect this wave's `resolveMsKnob` must not repeat (never captured into a module-level `const`; call it fresh at each use site).
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:159-387` (full read) — current `RetentionCleanupResult`, `deleteSnapshotRow` (`:189-193`, today a bare `db.delete(...)`, no lock, no pin check), `tryDeleteSnapshotRow` (`:205-221`, try/catch around the delete, returns boolean), and `cleanupExpiredSnapshots` (`:231-387`, two passes: `expired` — a single bulk SELECT then a JS loop calling `tryDeleteSnapshotRow` per row — and `versionBoundSnapshots`, grouped by `(deviceId, configId)` for the `maxVersions` prune). **No transaction of any kind exists today** — both passes run under whatever ambient context the caller already opened.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:60-64` — `const { db } = dbModule;` and `runWithSystemDbAccess = (fn) => typeof dbModule.withSystemDbAccessContext === 'function' ? dbModule.withSystemDbAccessContext(fn) : fn()`.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:77-130` (`createBackupWorker`, full read) — the BullMQ processor. `dispatch-backup` is special-cased **outside** the blanket wrap at `:89-99` (comment `:82-88` explains why: Redis/WS I/O via `agentCommandRelay` must not pin a pooled connection idle-in-transaction). Every other job type — including `cleanup-expired-snapshots` at `:109-111` — runs inside `return runWithSystemDbAccess(async () => { switch (data.type) { ... } })` at `:101`. `withDbAccessContext`/`withSystemDbAccessContext` (`apps/api/src/db/index.ts:525-554,610`) open exactly one real Postgres transaction (`baseDb.transaction(...)`) when no ambient context is already active, and are a no-op passthrough when nested inside one that already is. **This is the bug §3.7 fixes**: today, every retirement insert + row delete `cleanupExpiredSnapshots` performs, across every org and every candidate row, plus the entire GC sweep that follows it, all share the ONE transaction opened at `:101` — a later `failed > 0` throw or any savepoint rollback undoes retirements that already "committed" from the caller's point of view.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:325-395` — `processCleanupExpiredSnapshots` verbatim: loops `db.selectDistinct({ orgId }).from(backupSnapshots)`, calls `cleanupExpiredSnapshots(orgId)` per org, then `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects()` once (try/catch, GC failure never fails the job), then the deliberate D17 `if (failed > 0) throw ...` **last**, after the sweep has already run.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:982` — `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects` has **no internal `withSystemDbAccessContext`/`withDbAccessContext` call of its own** — it relies entirely on the ambient context the caller already opened. Pulling `cleanup-expired-snapshots` out of the blanket wrap (as this wave must) would leave this function's DB reads running with NO context at all unless Task 8's call site compensates. Per the coordinator's authoritative call-shape contract, Task 8 wraps the sweep call in exactly ONE `runWithSystemDbAccess`/`withSystemDbAccessContext` call (matching today's shape, so the function's existing GUC-dependent reads keep working) — internal per-identity context splitting is left entirely to W02 (§3.4/§3.7 item 2).
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:609-778` (`prepareBackupDispatchTargets`, full read) — builds `targets` (`:652`), loops `for (let i = 0; i < targets.length; i++)` (`:703`), creates a child `backup_jobs` row via `.insert(backupJobs)...returning()` for `i > 0` (`:713-733`, reusing `data.jobId` for `i === 0`), then builds `command.payload` at `:742-762`: `{ jobId, configId, provider, providerConfig: commandProviderConfig, storageEncryption, ...target.payload }` — no base/lease/identity fields today. This is the exact insertion point.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:399-431` — `resolveBackupTargets`: `case 'file'` and `case 'system_image'` both return `commandType: 'backup_run'`; hyperv/mssql return `hyperv_backup`/`mssql_backup` — never base-pinned. `system_image` payload is `{ systemImage: true }`; `file` payload is `{ paths, excludes? }`.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:26` — drizzle-orm import is `eq, ne, and, sql, isNull, lt, inArray` — `desc`, `or`, `gt` are NOT yet imported and must be added.
- `apps/api/src/services/orgCurrencyCore.ts:68,102`, `apps/api/src/jobs/softwareRemediationWorker.ts:248`, `apps/api/src/jobs/sensitiveDataJobs.ts:301,330,340` — confirmed directly: `.for('share')` and `.for('update')` (optionally `.for('update', { of: table })`) are established Drizzle patterns already in production code in this repo.
- `apps/api/src/routes/devices/moveOrg.ts:248-253` — the actual lock-order precedent (the spec's `:656` citation was stale): both parent org rows are locked `FOR SHARE`, in a fixed (ascending id) order, as the **first** statements of the transaction, before any dependent row is touched. Mirrored here as job-row-then-snapshot-row.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/staleCommandReaper.ts:97-100` — `BACKUP_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS = 15*60*1000`, `BACKUP_OFFLINE_GRACE_MS = 10*60*1000`, `BACKUP_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT_MS = 24*60*60*1000`, `BACKUP_PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS = 60*60*1000`. `:150-240` (`propagateTimedOutDeviceCommand`) matches `restoreJobs` **only by `commandId`** (`:220-240`, `WHERE command_id = $1 AND status IN ('pending','running')`) — a restore row created before its command row exists (`routes/backup/restore.ts:281,361`) is never reached by this function. `:1343-1482` (`reapStaleBackupJobs`) and `:1291` (`reapBackupJobRow`) are the exact per-domain reap pattern to mirror. `:1496-1505` `REAPER_DOMAINS` is the exported, module-scope array of `[name, fn]` pairs the BullMQ worker iterates, each wrapped individually in `runWithSystemDbAccess` (`:1517-1524`) — the new domain is added here.
- `apps/api/src/routes/backup/resultSchemas.ts:27-32` — `backupSnapshotResultSchema` today: `{ id, timestamp?, size?, files? }` only. No `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion`/`backupIdentity`.
- `apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.ts:972-981` — the terminal-job guard: `terminalJobGuard` (source `'agent'` branch) = `status='failed' AND errorLog LIKE '%[stale-backup-reaper]%'` (`STALE_BACKUP_REAP_MARKER`, imported from `../db/schema/backup` at `:11`). `:1041-1051` — `updatedJob` is `.returning({ id, orgId, configId, backupType, backupMode })` from the job UPDATE — must widen to also return `baseSnapshotId`, `publishLeaseExpiresAt`, `storageIdentity`. `:1143-1162` — `snapshotValues` object is where `parentSnapshotId`/`isIncremental`/`storageIdentity` must be added.
- `apps/api/src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.ts:135-155` — `ReconcileSkipReason` union (must widen with `'retired' | 'orphan-too-old-for-adoption' | 'base-missing'`). `:234-240` — `reconcileManifestSchema` (zod `.passthrough()`) already parses `formatVersion`/`baseSnapshotId` off the manifest. `:538-585` (`manifestToCommandResult`) builds its returned `snapshot: {...}` **without** forwarding either field — the exact gap Task 11 closes. `:592-973` (`reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots`, full read) — `writtenAt` is computed per candidate at `:705`, immediately followed by a `skip(reason)` closure (`:706-719`) and the `restorableOwner`/`foreignClaimed`/`claimingJob` checks (`:721-774`) — this is where the retired/orphan-age refusals are inserted. The manifest is only fetched and parsed later, in the adoption loop, at `:864-874` (`manifestToCommandResult` call) — the base-existence refusal belongs right after that, before `:882`.
- `apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts:354-469` (PATCH handler, full read) — `current` read at `:376-380`; `nextProviderConfig` computed at `:393-395`; the write transaction at `:440-452`; response built via `toConfigResponse(row)` at `:467`.
- `apps/api/src/db/schema/recoveryTokens.ts:20-57` (full file read) — `recoveryTokens.snapshotId` is a `uuid` FK to `backupSnapshots.id` (`ON DELETE SET NULL`), `status varchar(20) default('active')`, `completedAt timestamp` nullable, `expiresAt timestamp` NOT NULL. No `session_status` column.
- `apps/api/migrations/2026-04-11-bucket-a-rls-policies.sql:12-32` — exact shape-1 RLS pattern (four `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`, `ENABLE`+`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, four `CREATE POLICY breeze_org_isolation_{select,insert,update,delete}` using `public.breeze_has_org_access(org_id)`), copied verbatim in Task 3's migration.
- `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts:169-179` — `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` reads `..., 'backup_chains', 'backup_configs', 'backup_jobs', 'backup_policies', 'backup_profiles', 'backup_sla_configs', 'backup_sla_events', 'backup_snapshots', 'backup_verifications', ...` at exactly those lines. `'backup_snapshot_retirements'.localeCompare('backup_snapshots')` is negative (`'_r' < '_s'` after the shared `backup_snapshot` prefix), so the new entry sorts between `'backup_sla_events'` and `'backup_snapshots'`.
- `apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts:257-270` — `CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES` reads `'backup_chains', 'backup_jobs', 'backup_sla_events', 'backup_snapshots', 'backup_verifications', ...` — same insertion point.
- `apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts:463-478` — `CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES` is explicitly children-before-parents ORDERED (comment `:475-478`): `'recovery_tokens', 'backup_chains', 'restore_jobs', 'backup_verifications', 'backup_snapshots', 'backup_jobs', ...`. `backup_snapshot_retirements.device_id` is nullable `ON DELETE SET NULL` — SET NULL never raises an FK violation regardless of position, so it can be added anywhere; placed right after `'backup_jobs'` for readability.
- `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:118-125` — exact `tablePolicy("org_id", {...})` shape; `backup_jobs`'s current `included` list and `backup_snapshots`'s current `included` list quoted verbatim in Task 4.
- `apps/api/vitest.integration.config.ts` (full read) — `include` contains `'src/__tests__/integration/**/*.test.ts'` as a standing glob entry — new files under that directory need **no config edit**.
- `apps/api/package.json:26` — `"test": "vitest"` (bare, watch-mode by default — the `--` trap applies). No `typecheck` script exists; use `pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit` per CLAUDE.md.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.test.ts:1-75` (full read) — the `chainable(rows)` mock helper (`from/where/leftJoin/innerJoin/orderBy/limit` all return `obj`, `.then()` resolves `rows`), a FIFO `selectQueue` consumed by `mockDb.select`, `vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: mockDb }))`. **No `.for()` method on `chainable`, no `insert`, no `withSystemDbAccessContext` export from the mock today** — Task 9's test setup must add all three.
- `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts:1-59` (full read) — `mockDb` with `select/from/where/limit` chainable via `mockReturnThis()`, `vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: mockDb, withSystemDbAccessContext: undefined, runOutsideDbContext: (fn) => fn(), SYSTEM_DB_ACCESS_CONTEXT: {...} }))`, `cleanupExpiredSnapshots`/`sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects` mocked wholesale from `./backupRetention`, `__testOnly` exported from `backupWorker.ts` for driving `processDispatchBackup` directly. No `mockDb.transaction` today — Task 6's test adds one.
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/staleBackupReaper.integration.test.ts` (full read) — the real-DB integration-test convention this wave's new suites mirror: `import './setup'`, `it.runIf(!!process.env.DATABASE_URL)`, seed via `withSystemDbAccessContext(async () => { ... insert partner/org/site/device/config/job ... })`, exercise the real function, assert via a second `withSystemDbAccessContext` read.
- **Round-2 review findings, independently re-verified:**
  - `apps/api/src/db/index.ts:124-129` — the REAL `DbAccessContext` interface: `{ scope: DbAccessScope; orgId: string | null; accessibleOrgIds: string[] | null; accessiblePartnerIds?: string[] | null; userId?: string | null; currentPartnerId?: string | null; ... }`. There is NO `partnerId` field — an earlier draft's `{ scope, orgId, partnerId: null }` in the RLS forge test was simply a no-op extra property, not a real context value.
  - `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/agentRollbackRls.integration.test.ts:12-13` — the established `orgContext(orgId)` helper convention: `{ scope: 'organization', orgId, accessibleOrgIds: [orgId], accessiblePartnerIds: [], userId: null }`. `:105` confirms a Drizzle `.insert(...)` rejection wraps the real Postgres error under `.cause` (`rejects.toMatchObject({ cause: { code: '23505' } })`), while `:128`'s raw `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` rejection carries `.code` at the top level instead — the two are NOT interchangeable.
  - `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/db-utils.ts:59,106,146` — `createUser`/`createPartner`/`createOrganization` are the established seed helpers this suite's integration tests use in preference to hand-rolled inserts; no `createDevice` helper exists there (device rows are inserted directly, as `staleBackupReaper.integration.test.ts` and this plan's own tests already do).
  - `apps/api/scripts/check-drift.ts:1-31` (header) — `db:check-drift` verifies ONLY that the hand-written migration set applies cleanly and that `breeze_migrations` has one row per file; its own comment block is explicit that "Schema-vs-live-DB structural drift" is deliberately NOT checked here (drizzle-kit's introspect/generate round-trip produces too many false positives in this repo) — that is covered instead by the real-DB integration tests and PR review. It CANNOT fail or pass based on a Drizzle schema TypeScript change alone.
  - `apps/api/src/testUtils/integrationDatabaseSafety.ts` — `assertTestDatabaseUrlSafe` REFUSES any connection whose database name doesn't match `/^breeze_test(_[a-z0-9]+)?$/`, whose host isn't in a local allowlist, or whose port is `5432` (the dev/prod default) — the dev-DB URL used elsewhere in this repo's docs (`postgresql://breeze:breeze@localhost:5432/breeze`) is exactly the shape this rejects. `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/setup.ts:32-33` defaults `DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_URL_APP` to `postgresql://breeze_test:breeze_test@localhost:5433/breeze_test` when unset, and `docker-compose.test.yml:27-33` provisions exactly that database on port 5433 — the integration runner needs NO `DATABASE_URL` override at all locally as long as that compose service is up.
  - `apps/api/src/jobs/queueSchemas.ts` — `backupSnapshotSummarySchema` (the block starting `const backupSnapshotSummarySchema = z.object({`) is `.strict()` and today declares only `id`/`timestamp`/`size`/`files` — none of this wave's `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion`/`backupIdentity` fields. `apps/api/src/jobs/backupEnqueue.ts:79-117` — `ProcessResultsResult` is a plain (non-Zod) TS interface with the same gap at its `snapshot?: {...}` sub-type (`:105-115`). `enqueueBackupResults` (`:161-187`) parses its `result` argument through `backupQueueJobDataSchema.parse(...)` — the same schema `backupWorker.ts`'s `parseQueueJobData` uses at `:81` — so a `.strict()` mismatch either throws at enqueue time or silently strips the fields, and either way the lineage data added in `resultSchemas.ts` (the WS-ingress schema) never reaches `backupResultPersistence.ts`.

## File structure

- **Create** `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160201-backup-jobs-base-pin-and-storage-identity.sql` — new `backup_jobs` columns + partial index; nullable `backup_snapshots.storage_identity` column, DDL only, no backfill.
- **Create** `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160202-backup-snapshot-retirements.sql` — new table + shape-1 RLS.

- **Modify** `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts` — add columns to `backupJobs`/`backupSnapshots`, new `backupSnapshotRetirements` table.
- **Modify** `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` — registries.

### Task 1: Migration 160201 — `backup_jobs` pin/identity columns + nullable `backup_snapshots.storage_identity` (DDL only)

**Files:** Create `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160201-backup-jobs-base-pin-and-storage-identity.sql`.

**Decision (no backfill — coordinator directive, spec §3.6/§4 amended):** this migration is DDL only. `backup_snapshots.storage_identity` is added nullable with **no UPDATE and no `breeze.scope` elevation** — every existing row is simply left NULL. W02's sweep self-heals each NULL row by matching it against a live bucket listing (per row id), so no SQL or TS backfill of any kind is needed here. This replaces an earlier draft of this task that ported `normalizeStorageIdentity` into PL/pgSQL for a guarded subset of rows — dropped entirely, not merely deferred.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test — this migration has no unit-testable TS surface; the "red" step is observing the column/table absence against a real DB.
  Command: `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze -c "\d backup_jobs"` → confirm `base_snapshot_id`/`publish_lease_expires_at`/`storage_identity` are absent.

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL (columns absent) — already true, this is the baseline.

- [ ] Step 3: Implement

```sql
-- apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160201-backup-jobs-base-pin-and-storage-identity.sql
-- D18 W01 (#5429 family, spec v3 §3.1/§3.6): server-chosen incremental-dedupe
-- base pin with a fixed publish-lease deadline, plus a per-job/per-snapshot
-- storage identity that survives a backup_configs destination edit.
--
-- publish_lease_expires_at is set for EVERY dispatched file/system_image job
-- (base or not) at DISPATCH time only — it is never renewed (no delivery
-- channel exists to renew it; see backupWorker.ts's stampDispatchPinAndIdentity
-- docstring). storage_identity on backup_snapshots is nullable FOREVER: no
-- follow-up NOT NULL migration exists for it, and this migration does NOT
-- backfill it — every existing row is left NULL. The W02 GC sweep self-heals
-- each NULL row by matching it (by row id) against a live bucket listing; no
-- SQL or TS backfill of any kind is required or attempted here.
--
-- DDL only — no UPDATE, no breeze.scope elevation needed. Idempotent:
-- IF NOT EXISTS on every column/index.

DO $$
BEGIN
  ALTER TABLE backup_jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS base_snapshot_id varchar(255);
  ALTER TABLE backup_jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS publish_lease_expires_at timestamptz;
  ALTER TABLE backup_jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS storage_identity text;

  RAISE NOTICE 'backup_snapshots: storage_identity ensured (nullable, no NOT NULL, no backfill — every row starts NULL and is self-healed by the W02 GC sweep from a live bucket listing)';
END $$;
```

- [ ] Step 4: Run, expect PASS
  Commands:
  - `pnpm db:migrate`
  - `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze -c "\d backup_jobs"` — confirm all three columns present.
  - `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze -c "SELECT count(*) FROM backup_snapshots WHERE storage_identity IS NOT NULL;"` — expect `0` (no backfill).

- [ ] Step 5: Commit
  `git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160201-backup-jobs-base-pin-and-storage-identity.sql && git commit -m "feat(backup): base-pin/storage-identity columns, DDL only, no backfill (D18 W01)"`

### Task 2: Drizzle schema edits — `backup.ts` new columns + `backupSnapshotRetirements` table

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts` (add to `backupJobs` after `snapshotId` ~:247, `backupSnapshots` after `backupType` ~:322, new table after `backupSnapshotFiles` ~:356).

**Interfaces:** Produces `backupSnapshotRetirements` Drizzle table export, `backupJobs.baseSnapshotId`/`.publishLeaseExpiresAt`/`.storageIdentity` (+ a matching partial index), `backupSnapshots.storageIdentity`.

- [ ] Step 1: There is no automated red/green test for this task. **Correction (review fix):** `pnpm db:check-drift` does NOT compare the Drizzle schema against a live database at all — it verifies migration-ledger parity (every file in `apps/api/migrations/` has exactly one `breeze_migrations` row after a fresh apply; see `scripts/check-drift.ts:17-24`'s own header comment: "What is intentionally NOT checked here. Schema-vs-live-DB drift..."). It cannot fail or pass based on anything in this task. The actual verification for a Drizzle schema change is: (a) `pnpm db:migrate` applies cleanly against a fresh DB, (b) running it a SECOND time is a true no-op (idempotency), and (c) the integration tests written in Task 13 actually insert/query through these Drizzle table objects against real Postgres — that is what proves the TypeScript column definitions match the real column types/names.
  Command (idempotency check, run against a disposable local DB): `pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:migrate` — second run must report zero newly-applied migrations.

- [ ] Step 2: (No FAIL step — see Step 1's correction. Proceed directly to Step 3.)

- [ ] Step 3: Implement

```ts
// apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts — inside backupJobs' column object, after `snapshotId` (~:247)
    // D18 W01 (#5429/§3.1): server-chosen incremental-dedupe base for this

    // row's own lifecycle; retention checks this column directly.
    baseSnapshotId: varchar('base_snapshot_id', { length: 255 }),
    // Fixed publish deadline, set once at dispatch for EVERY dispatched
    // file/system_image job (base or not) — never renewed (no delivery
    // channel exists to renew it on progress). A pin is live while

export const backupSnapshotRetirements = pgTable(

- [ ] Step 4: Run, expect PASS
  Commands:
  - `pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:migrate` (idempotency — second run is a no-op)
  - `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze -c "\d backup_jobs"` — confirm `backup_jobs_base_snapshot_id_idx` exists.

### Task 3: `backup_snapshot_retirements` table + RLS migration

**Files:** Create `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-15-160202-backup-snapshot-retirements.sql`.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test
  Command: `docker exec -it breeze-postgres psql -U breeze_app -d breeze -c "SELECT * FROM backup_snapshot_retirements LIMIT 1;"` → expect `ERROR: relation "backup_snapshot_retirements" does not exist`.

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL (as above).

### Task 4: Registries — `tenantCascade.ts`, `devices/core.ts`, `tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts`

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts` (insert between the verified `'backup_sla_events'`/`'backup_snapshots'` lines), `apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts` (both lists), `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts` (widen two entries + one new entry).

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test (these are existing contract tests — run them first to establish red/green)
  Commands:
  - `find apps/api/src -iname "tenantCascade*integration*"` to confirm the exact path, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <that path>`
  - `ls apps/api/src/routes/devices/*.test.ts | grep -iE "cascade|moveorg"` to confirm exact filenames, then run both
  - `grep -n check-tenant-export-policy apps/api/package.json` to confirm the invocation, then run it

- [ ] Step 2: Run against Task 2/3's new schema with NO registry edits yet, expect FAIL:
  - cascade test: `backup_snapshot_retirements has an org_id column but is missing from CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`
  - device cascade tests: `backup_snapshot_retirements has a device_id column but is missing from CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES` / `...CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES`

### Task 6: Dispatch — base selection, lease + storage-identity stamping, lock order job→snapshot

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:26` (imports), new function placed just above `prepareBackupDispatchTargets` (before line 609), and the per-target loop body (`:742` insertion point). Test: `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `resolveBackupBaseLeaseMs()` from `./services/backupGcKnobs`; `normalizeStorageIdentity` from `./backupRetention`; `backupSnapshotRetirements` schema; `desc`/`or`/`gt` added to the `drizzle-orm` import.
- Produces: new function `stampDispatchPinAndIdentity(params): Promise<{ baseSnapshotId: string; publishLeaseExpiresAt: Date | null }>`, called for **every** dispatched target regardless of `commandType`. `storage_identity` is stamped on `backup_jobs` for every target, including `hyperv_backup`/`mssql_backup` (review fix — GC must be able to group those rows by identity too), but `publish_lease_expires_at` and `base_snapshot_id` are set/attempted only when `mode` is `'file'`/`'system_image'` (`mode: null` for hyperv/mssql skips the pin/lease logic entirely). Payload fields `baseSnapshotId: string` (`""` = full run) and `publishLeaseExpiresAt: string` (RFC3339) are added only to `backup_run` commands' payloads (unchanged — pins/leases stay file/system_image-only at the wire-protocol level per spec).

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts — new describe block; add `transaction` to mockDb first:

    // Three selects in the transaction, in order: (1) the base-candidate
    // lookup (.limit(1)), (2) the FOR SHARE lock on backup_snapshots ALONE
    // (.for('share') — no leftJoin, per the Postgres outer-join fix), and
    // (3) the plain, unlocked retirement-existence check (.limit(1),
    // returns [] = "not retired"). All three must resolve for the base to
    // be pinned.
    let selectCall = 0;
    mockDb.select.mockImplementation(() => {
      selectCall += 1;
      return {

    await __testOnly.processDispatchBackup(DATA as any);

    expect(capturedCommand?.payload?.baseSnapshotId).toBe('base-snap-1');
    expect(typeof capturedCommand?.payload?.publishLeaseExpiresAt).toBe('string');

  it('sends baseSnapshotId "" and still sets publishLeaseExpiresAt when no eligible base exists', async () => {

});
```

  (Adapt the exact chain shape to whatever `wireSelects()`-style helper this file already uses elsewhere in its suite — read the surrounding `describe('processDispatchBackup ...')` block before writing, and mirror its existing convention for routing `db.select({...})` calls by column-selector shape; the assertions above are the exact contract regardless of mock plumbing.)

/**
 * D18 §3.1/§3.6: stamps this job's storage_identity (from the providerConfig
 * actually placed in the dispatch payload) on EVERY dispatched target —
 * including `hyperv_backup`/`mssql_backup` (review fix: GC must be able to
 * group those rows by identity too, even though they never carry a base pin)
 * — and, only when `mode` is `'file'`/`'system_image'`, a FIXED publish-lease
 * deadline plus, when an eligible incremental-dedupe base exists, a pin on it.
 * `mode: null` (hyperv/mssql) stamps identity only and returns immediately.
 *
 * Lock order is JOB then SNAPSHOT (mirrors the parent-rows-first pattern at
 * routes/devices/moveOrg.ts:248-253): the UPDATE on backup_jobs below takes
 * the job row's lock first. The snapshot-row re-check is then done as TWO
 * separate statements, not one outer-joined `FOR SHARE` — Postgres rejects
 * `FOR UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE` on the nullable side of an outer join (review
 * fix: the original draft's `leftJoin(backupSnapshotRetirements, ...)` inside
 * a `.for('share')` chain is exactly that and would raise `0A000` at
 * runtime). First, `FOR SHARE` locks `backup_snapshots` ALONE; only once that
 * lock is held is `backup_snapshot_retirements` checked with a second, plain
 * (unlocked) SELECT — safe because by the time the FOR SHARE lock is granted,
 * any concurrent retention transaction that already inserted a retirement row
 * for this snapshot has either fully committed (so its retirement row is
 * visible here) or is blocked behind this same lock (so no retirement can
 * appear between the two selects). Retention's per-row delete
 * (backupRetention.ts) takes `FOR UPDATE` on the same snapshot row —
 * whichever side gets there first wins: the other either sees the live pin
 * (and skips) or finds the row already gone (and this function falls back to
 * a full run). No FK-column write happens while a lock from the other table
 * is held (cf. #3911's key-share deadlock).

### Task 8: Transaction boundaries (§3.7) — carve `cleanup-expired-snapshots` out of the worker's blanket wrap

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.ts:77-130` (`createBackupWorker`), `:325-395` (`processCleanupExpiredSnapshots`). Test: `apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts`.

**Interfaces — authoritative call shape for W02 (corrected per coordinator's second review pass):** this task's restructure of `processCleanupExpiredSnapshots` is the contract W02 builds on. After row-level retention has committed per row (Task 9), the handler wraps the sweep in exactly **ONE** shared context — `await runWithSystemDbAccess(() => sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects())` — matching today's read shape so `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects`'s existing internal `db.select(...)` calls keep the working GUCs they rely on today (they have no context management of their own — Ground Truth, `backupRetention.ts:982`). This is deliberately ONE context for the whole sweep, not per-identity — W02 is expected to replace this single wrap with genuinely separate per-identity contexts internally (spec §3.7 item 2: "a separate system context per identity for the DB reads, with every storage call at depth 0"), at which point this call site's wrap is removed and the per-identity splitting moves inside `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects` itself. This task adds no new fields to `processCleanupExpiredSnapshots`'s returned/logged result shape (`gcDeleted`/`gcSkippedIdentities`/`gcBlockedIdentities` only) — W02 is the one expected to add fields there as its own internal restructuring surfaces more detail.

**Why this task must land before Task 9:** Task 9 restructures `cleanupExpiredSnapshots` (in `backupRetention.ts`) to open its own real per-row transaction via `withSystemDbAccessContext`. That only works if the call arrives with NO ambient context already open — today it's nested inside the blanket `runWithSystemDbAccess(async () => { switch(...) {...} })` at `backupWorker.ts:101`, where a nested `withSystemDbAccessContext` call is a no-op passthrough (same outer transaction, no new commit boundary). This task removes that ambient wrap for `cleanup-expired-snapshots` the same way `dispatch-backup` is already excluded from it (`:89-99`), while the sweep call — which runs strictly AFTER every row's retention has already committed independently — gets its own single, separate context (see Interfaces above), so a sweep failure can never roll back a retirement that already committed.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test — a source-text contract test, mirroring the style of `backupAgentContract.test.ts`'s cross-file literal checks, since this is a structural wiring invariant rather than a behavior a mock can observe.

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts — new case
  it('handles cleanup-expired-snapshots OUTSIDE the blanket runWithSystemDbAccess wrap (D18 W01 §3.7)', async () => {
    const fs = await import('node:fs');
    const path = await import('node:path');
    const source = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './backupWorker.ts'), 'utf-8');

    const cleanupBranchIndex = source.indexOf("data.type === 'cleanup-expired-snapshots'");
    const blanketWrapIndex = source.indexOf('return runWithSystemDbAccess(async () => {');
    const switchCleanupCaseIndex = source.indexOf("case 'cleanup-expired-snapshots':");

    expect(cleanupBranchIndex).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
    expect(blanketWrapIndex).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
    // The special-cased branch must appear BEFORE the blanket wrap.
    expect(cleanupBranchIndex).toBeLessThan(blanketWrapIndex);
    // The switch inside the blanket wrap must no longer have its own
    // 'cleanup-expired-snapshots' case.
    expect(switchCleanupCaseIndex).toBe(-1);
  });
```

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL — `cleanupBranchIndex` is `-1` and `switchCleanupCaseIndex` is still found inside the switch.
  Command: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts`

      // that follows must run in its own separate context so a sweep
      // failure can never roll back a retirement already committed.
      // processCleanupExpiredSnapshots (below) manages both of those
      // contexts itself — nesting it inside runWithSystemDbAccess here would
      // silently collapse every one of those into the single ambient

### Task 9: Retention — per-row commits, pin checks (backup/restore/recovery), retirement insert

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:9-31` (imports), `:159-171` (`RetentionCleanupResult`), `:189-221` (`deleteSnapshotRow`/`tryDeleteSnapshotRow`, rewritten), `:231-387` (`cleanupExpiredSnapshots`, read/pin/delete phases re-wrapped). Test: `apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `withSystemDbAccessContext` from `../db`; `resolveBackupRestorePinLingerMs`/`resolveBackupPublishMarginMs` from `../services/backupGcKnobs`; `restoreJobs`, `backupSnapshotRetirements`, `IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES` from `../db/schema` (the barrel — resolved open question 3: `backupRetention.test.ts:34` mocks `'../db'` only, not `'../db/schema'`, and this file's existing imports already pull `backupSnapshots`/`backupPolicies`/`backupJobs`/`configPolicyBackupSettings`/`backupConfigs` from that same barrel, so the new symbols join that one import statement rather than a separate `'../db/schema/backup'` line); `recoveryTokens` from `../db/schema/recoveryTokens` (a direct, non-barrel import — the same convention `backupWorker.ts:24` already uses for this specific table); `gt` and `sql` added to the `drizzle-orm` import.
- Produces: `RetentionCleanupResult` gains `skippedPinned: number` AND `skippedUnresolved: number` (review fix). `tryDeleteSnapshotRow` now returns `'deleted' | 'pinned' | 'legalHold' | 'immutable' | 'unresolved' | 'failed'` (was `boolean`) and opens its own `withSystemDbAccessContext` per call — one real top-level transaction per candidate row, per §3.7. Legal-hold and immutability are now decided ONLY inside `deleteSnapshotRow`, re-read under the `FOR UPDATE` lock — the caller's enumeration-pass copy of those columns is no longer trusted (review fix). A row whose `storageIdentity` is `NULL` is skipped (not retired with an invented identity — the `unknown::<uuid>` fallback is removed entirely) and counted as `skippedUnresolved`; it is retried on a later run once identity resolves. Every lookup that matches a snapshot by its bare (agent-supplied) `snapshotId` string is scoped by `storageIdentity` too, since `backup_snapshots.snapshot_id` carries no uniqueness constraint (`schema/backup.ts:330`, `snapshotIdIdx` is a plain, non-unique index) — a bare `snapshotId` match alone is not guaranteed to identify one row.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test — update the shared `chainable`/`mockDb` fixture first (it currently has no `.for()`, no `insert`, and the `'../db'` mock exports only `db`):

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.test.ts — fixture changes near the top of the file
function chainable(rows: unknown[]) {
  const obj: Record<string, unknown> = {
    from: () => obj,
    where: () => obj,
    leftJoin: () => obj,
    innerJoin: () => obj,
    orderBy: () => obj,
    limit: () => obj,
    for: () => obj,
    then: (resolve: (v: unknown[]) => unknown, reject?: (e: unknown) => unknown) =>
      Promise.resolve(rows).then(resolve, reject),
  };
  return obj;
}

const selectQueue: unknown[][] = [];
const insertedRows: unknown[] = [];

const mockDb = {
  select: vi.fn(() => chainable(selectQueue.shift() ?? [])),
  delete: vi.fn(() => chainable([])),
  update: vi.fn(() => chainable([])),
  insert: vi.fn((table: unknown) => ({
    values: (v: unknown) => {
      insertedRows.push(v);
      return chainable([]);
    },
  })),
};

vi.mock('../db', () => ({
  db: mockDb,
  withSystemDbAccessContext: (fn: () => unknown) => fn(),
}));
```

    expect(result.skippedLegalHold).toBe(1);

    expect(insertedRows.length).toBe(0);
  });

```

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL — `result.skippedPinned`/`result.skippedUnresolved` are `undefined` (fields don't exist yet); `insertedRows` stays empty in the second case (no retirement is written today); the legal-hold re-read case fails because today's code decides legal hold from the enumeration pass, before the FOR UPDATE lock select is even issued.
  Command: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/backupRetention.test.ts`

- [ ] Step 3: Implement

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:9-18 — widen imports
import { resolve as resolveLocalPath } from 'node:path';
import { db, withSystemDbAccessContext } from '../db';
import {
  backupSnapshots,
  backupPolicies,
  backupJobs,
  configPolicyBackupSettings,
  backupConfigs,
  restoreJobs,
  backupSnapshotRetirements,
  IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES,
} from '../db/schema';
import { recoveryTokens } from '../db/schema/recoveryTokens';
import { eq, and, or, lt, gt, desc, inArray, isNull, sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { resolveBackupRestorePinLingerMs, resolveBackupPublishMarginMs } from '../services/backupGcKnobs';
```

  (Resolved: `backupRetention.test.ts:34` only mocks `vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: mockDb }))` — there is no `vi.mock('../db/schema', ...)` in this file at all, so real schema symbols always flow through regardless of which schema path they're imported from. The existing imports (`backupSnapshots`/`backupPolicies`/`backupJobs`/`configPolicyBackupSettings`/`backupConfigs`) already come from the barrel `'../db/schema'`, so `restoreJobs`/`backupSnapshotRetirements`/`IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES` join that same statement rather than introducing a second, `'../db/schema/backup'`-rooted import for the same underlying module.)

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:159-171 — RetentionCleanupResult gains fields
export type RetentionCleanupResult = {
  deleted: number;
  skippedLegalHold: number;
  skippedImmutable: number;
  skippedPinned: number;
  // D18 review fix: a row whose storage_identity is unresolved (NULL) is
  // never retired with an invented identity — it is retried on a later run
  // once identity resolves (a live write stamping it, or W02's sweep
  // self-heal). Counted separately from skippedPinned so operators can see
  // "how many rows are stuck on identity resolution" distinctly.
  skippedUnresolved: number;
  prunedByMaxVersions: number;
  failed: number;
};
```

```ts
// apps/api/src/jobs/backupRetention.ts:189-221 — replace deleteSnapshotRow + tryDeleteSnapshotRow
type DeleteSnapshotOutcome = 'deleted' | 'pinned' | 'legalHold' | 'immutable' | 'unresolved';

/**
 * Deletes a `backup_snapshots` ROW ONLY, after RE-READING legal hold /
 * immutability under the row's own `FOR UPDATE` lock (review fix — the
 * caller's enumeration-pass copy of those columns can be stale by the time
 * this row's turn comes up: a hold set or cleared in between must be honored
 * NOW, not then), checking every pin type (D18 §3.2: backup-job base pin via
 * publish_lease_expires_at + margin, restore-job pin, recovery-token pin),
 * and writing a durable retirement tombstone (backup_snapshot_retirements) in
 * the SAME per-row system context as the delete. The caller
 * (`tryDeleteSnapshotRow`) wraps this whole function in its own
 * `withSystemDbAccessContext` call — since `cleanupExpiredSnapshots` is no
 * longer invoked from inside any ambient transaction (D18 §3.7,
 * jobs/backupWorker.ts), that call opens a REAL top-level Postgres
 * transaction distinct from every other row's, so a retirement written here
 * commits durably before the next candidate row is even considered.
 *
 * A row whose `storage_identity` is NULL is never retired with an invented
 * identity (review fix — the earlier `unknown::<uuid>` fallback is removed
 * entirely): a retirement's uniqueness and every lookup against it is keyed
 * on `(storage_identity, snapshot_id)`, and a fabricated identity would let
 * two genuinely different unresolved rows collide, or hand GC an identity it
 * can never match against a real bucket listing. Such a row is left alone
 * (`'unresolved'`) and retried on a later run once identity resolves.
 *
 * Every lookup that matches a row by the bare (agent-supplied) `snapshotId`
 * string is additionally scoped by `storageIdentity`, since
 * `backup_snapshots.snapshot_id` carries no uniqueness constraint
 * (`schema/backup.ts:330` — `snapshotIdIdx` is a plain, non-unique index): a
 * bare string match alone is not guaranteed to identify the row this
 * function is actually retiring.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch object storage — under the incremental/
 * synthetic-full manifest model, an incremental snapshot's unchanged files
 * are references whose backupPath points into an OLDER snapshot's prefix, so
 * eagerly nuking this snapshot's whole storage prefix the instant its row
 * expires would delete objects a still-retained sibling snapshot's manifest
 * still points at. Object deletion is the mark-and-sweep GC's exclusive job
 * (sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects, W02): the retirement row this function
 * writes is what lets that sweep treat this snapshot's exclusive objects as
 * garbage immediately, with no age-based ambiguity between "expired" and
 * merely "orphaned".

### Task 10: Lineage on write — `resultSchemas.ts` + `backupResultPersistence.ts` + late-result fence

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/routes/backup/resultSchemas.ts:27-32`, `apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.ts:1041-1051` (widen `updatedJob` select), `:972-981` area (new pre-check before the main UPDATE), `:1143-1162` (`snapshotValues`); `apps/api/src/jobs/queueSchemas.ts` (`backupSnapshotSummarySchema`, `.strict()`); `apps/api/src/jobs/backupEnqueue.ts` (`ProcessResultsResult.snapshot` interface). Test: `apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.test.ts`, plus a new queue-round-trip regression test.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `backupSnapshotResultSchema` gains `baseSnapshotId?: string`, `formatVersion?: number`, `backupIdentity?: string`.
- Produces: `backupSnapshots.parentSnapshotId`/`.isIncremental`/`.storageIdentity` are now set on every successful write; `storageIdentity` is **copied from the job's own stamped `storageIdentity`** (Task 6), never recomputed from the config; the base-row lookup for `parentSnapshotId` is scoped by `(storageIdentity, snapshotId)`, not `(configId, snapshotId)` — `snapshot_id` carries no uniqueness constraint (review fix, `schema/backup.ts:330`).
- Produces: a late result for a reaped-terminal job is rejected with `errorLog` containing `publish_lease_expired` (also fires when the lease is NULL — review fix, no implicit pass) or `base_retired` when the fence fails. The whole check-and-write happens inside one `db.transaction` with `FOR UPDATE` on the job row, scoped by `(id, deviceId)` matching the file's own #3036 tenant-scoping convention (review fix — atomic against a concurrently running `staleCommandReaper` pass, and never keyed on job id alone).
- **P1 queue-schema propagation (review finding):** `apps/api/src/jobs/queueSchemas.ts`'s `backupSnapshotSummarySchema` is `.strict()` and does not yet declare `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion`/`backupIdentity` — every one of this task's new fields is silently stripped (or the whole `.strict()` parse throws) before `backupWorker.ts`'s `process-results` handler (`parseQueueJobData` at `:81`) or the earlier `enqueueBackupResults` call in `backupEnqueue.ts` ever sees them, making the lineage fields dead on arrival end to end. This task widens `backupSnapshotSummarySchema` (queue ingress/egress validation) AND the plain TS interface `ProcessResultsResult.snapshot` (`backupEnqueue.ts:105-115`, which has no `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion` fields today either) to match `resultSchemas.ts`'s `backupSnapshotResultSchema` shape, and adds a regression test proving a result carrying these fields survives an `enqueueBackupResults` → `parseQueueJobData` round trip.

  Add `backupSnapshotRetirements` to this file's EXISTING barrel import (`apps/api/src/services/backupResultPersistence.ts:3-12`, which already pulls `backupJobs`/`backupSnapshotFiles`/`backupSnapshots`/`backupPolicies`/`configPolicyBackupSettings`/`backupConfigs`/`IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES`/`STALE_BACKUP_REAP_MARKER` from `'../db/schema'`) — do not add a second, separate `'../db/schema/backup'` import line for the same table.

**P1 review finding — queue schema propagation.** Everything above is dead on arrival without this: `apps/api/src/jobs/queueSchemas.ts`'s `backupSnapshotSummarySchema` is `.strict()` and `apps/api/src/jobs/backupEnqueue.ts`'s `ProcessResultsResult.snapshot` is a plain TS interface — NEITHER declares `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion`/`backupIdentity` today, so the fields this task adds to `resultSchemas.ts`'s WS-ingress schema are stripped (or the whole `.strict()` parse throws) before `backupWorker.ts`'s `process-results` handler ever sees them.

### Task 11: Reconcile — forward lineage, refuse retired/too-old/base-missing adoption

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.ts:135-155` (`ReconcileSkipReason`), `:538-585` (`manifestToCommandResult`), `:669-720` (new pre-loop retired-id lookup + in-loop checks), the `ClaimingJob` type + `loadClaimsAndSharing` query + the `claimingJob` branch of the per-candidate loop (new "late-result-fenced" check — locate by searching `ADOPTABLE_JOB_STATUSES.includes` in this file), `:864-882` (new base-existence check after the manifest parses). Test: `apps/api/src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Consumes `backupSnapshotRetirements` schema. `RECONCILE_ORPHAN_HALF_WINDOW_MS` is a local literal (half of the 9-day default `BACKUP_GC_ORPHAN_MANIFEST_MAX_AGE_MS`, which doesn't exist as a named knob until W02) with a `TODO(W02)` to replace it once `backupGcKnobs.ts` grows that export. **Review fix:** reconcile must also refuse to adopt a job whose late result was already fenced off by Task 10's late-result fence — such a job is `status: 'failed'` with `errorLog` containing `publish_lease_expired` or `base_retired`; re-adopting it via the write-time-window path would resurrect exactly the state the fence exists to prevent. New skip reason `'late-result-fenced'`.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test

```ts
// apps/api/src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.test.ts — new cases
  it('manifestToCommandResult forwards baseSnapshotId and formatVersion', () => {
    const result = manifestToCommandResult({
      snapshotId: 'snap-1',
      manifestText: JSON.stringify({ id: 'snap-1', baseSnapshotId: 'snap-0', formatVersion: 2, files: [] }),
      matchedBy: 'job-snapshot-id',
    });
    expect(result.snapshot?.baseSnapshotId).toBe('snap-0');
    expect(result.snapshot?.formatVersion).toBe(2);
  });

  it('refuses to adopt a retired snapshot id', async () => {
    // Arrange listing to include snapshot RETIRED-1; the retirement lookup
    // (mocked select) returns a matching row for (storageIdentity, RETIRED-1).
    const result = await reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots({ orgId: 'org-1', configId: 'config-1' });
    const candidate = result.candidates.find((c) => c.snapshotId === 'RETIRED-1');
    expect(candidate?.skipReason).toBe('retired');
    expect(candidate?.adopted).toBe(false);
  });

  it('refuses to adopt a manifest older than half the orphan window', async () => {
    // Arrange listing with a manifest lastModified older than 4.5 days (half
    // the 9-day default) with no retirement row.
    const result = await reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots({ orgId: 'org-1', configId: 'config-1' });
    const candidate = result.candidates.find((c) => c.snapshotId === 'OLD-ORPHAN');
    expect(candidate?.skipReason).toBe('orphan-too-old-for-adoption');
  });

  it('refuses to adopt a manifest whose declared base has no live, unretired row', async () => {
    // Arrange a fresh (well within the window), job-snapshot-id-matched
    // manifest declaring baseSnapshotId 'gone-base'; the base-existence
    // lookup (mocked select) returns no row.
    const result = await reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots({ orgId: 'org-1', configId: 'config-1' });
    const candidate = result.candidates.find((c) => c.snapshotId === 'HAS-MISSING-BASE');
    expect(candidate?.skipReason).toBe('base-missing');
    expect(candidate?.adopted).toBe(false);
  });

  it('refuses to adopt a job whose late result was already fenced (publish_lease_expired/base_retired)', async () => {
    // Arrange claims.jobs to include a job-snapshot-id match whose status is
    // 'failed' and errorLog contains 'base_retired' (Task 10's late-result
    // fence already fired for this exact job/snapshot pair).
    const result = await reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots({ orgId: 'org-1', configId: 'config-1' });
    const candidate = result.candidates.find((c) => c.snapshotId === 'FENCED-JOB-SNAP');
    expect(candidate?.skipReason).toBe('late-result-fenced');
    expect(candidate?.adopted).toBe(false);
  });
```

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL — `manifestToCommandResult`'s result has no `baseSnapshotId` field, and all three refusal cases adopt instead of skipping.
  Command: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.test.ts`

  Add `inArray`/`isNull` to this file's `drizzle-orm` import if not already present (confirm during implementation — several are already used elsewhere in the file for the claims lookups).

### Task 12: `PATCH /backup/configs/:id` — warn when the edit changes storage identity

**Files:** Modify `apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts:440-467`. Test: `apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Response from `PATCH /backup/configs/:id` gains a `warnings: string[]` field, **always present** (possibly empty — a stable contract for the frontend, per coordinator decision), populated with `'storage_identity_changed'` when the edit changes `normalizeStorageIdentity(provider, providerConfig)` for a config that has at least one `backup_snapshots` row. Never blocks the write.

- [ ] Step 1: Write the failing test

```ts
// apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.test.ts — new case (mirror this file's existing PATCH test setup)
  it('warns (does not block) when an s3 endpoint edit changes storage identity for a config with snapshots', async () => {
    // Arrange: `current` row is s3 with endpoint 'old.example.com', bucket 'b';
    // a snapshot-exists check for this configId returns a row; PATCH body
    // changes details.endpoint to 'new.example.com'.
    const res = await app.request('/backup/configs/config-1?orgId=org-1', {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json', authorization: 'Bearer test' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ details: { endpoint: 'new.example.com', bucket: 'b' } }),
    });
    const body = await res.json();
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    expect(body.warnings).toEqual(['storage_identity_changed']);
  });

  it('always includes warnings (empty) when the edit does not change storage identity', async () => {
    // Same config, PATCH body only changes `name`.
    const res = await app.request('/backup/configs/config-1?orgId=org-1', {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json', authorization: 'Bearer test' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Renamed' }),
    });
    const body = await res.json();
    expect(body.warnings).toEqual([]);
  });
```

- [ ] Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL — `body.warnings` is `undefined`.
  Command: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/backup/configs.test.ts`

- [ ] Step 3: Implement

```ts
// apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts:13 — widen the existing import (confirmed
// today: `import { backupConfigs } from '../../db/schema';` — backupSnapshots is
// NOT currently imported in this file; `eq`/`and` are already imported at :4)
import { backupConfigs, backupSnapshots } from '../../db/schema';
```

```ts
// apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts — new import
import { normalizeStorageIdentity } from '../../jobs/backupRetention';
```

```ts
// apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts — inside the PATCH handler, after the write
// transaction resolves `row` (~:452) and before the response (~:467):

    const warnings: string[] = [];
    const priorIdentity = normalizeStorageIdentity(current.provider, (current.providerConfig ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>);
    const nextIdentity = normalizeStorageIdentity(row.provider, (row.providerConfig ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>);
    if (priorIdentity !== nextIdentity) {
      const [existingSnapshot] = await db
        .select({ id: backupSnapshots.id })
        .from(backupSnapshots)
        .where(eq(backupSnapshots.configId, configId))
        .limit(1);
      if (existingSnapshot) {
        warnings.push('storage_identity_changed');
      }
    }

    writeRouteAudit(c, {
      orgId,
      action: 'backup.config.update',
      resourceType: 'backup_config',
      resourceId: row.id,
      resourceName: row.name,
      details: { changedFields: Object.keys(payload) },
    });

    // Always present (possibly empty) — a stable response shape, per
    // coordinator decision, rather than an optional field callers must guard.
    return c.json({ ...toConfigResponse(row), warnings });
```

  (Resolved: `backupSnapshots` was NOT already imported in `configs.ts` — confirmed by reading the file's import block; the widened import above adds it.)

- [ ] Step 4: Run, expect PASS
  Command: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/backup/configs.test.ts`

- [ ] Step 5: Commit

### Task 14: Wave verification

- [ ] `cd apps/api && npx tsc --noEmit` (or `pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit` — no dedicated `typecheck` script exists in `apps/api/package.json`, confirmed).
- [ ] `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/backupGcKnobs.test.ts src/jobs/backupWorker.test.ts src/jobs/staleCommandReaper.test.ts src/jobs/backupRetention.test.ts src/services/backupResultPersistence.test.ts src/services/backupSnapshotReconcile.test.ts src/routes/backup/configs.test.ts src/jobs/backupEnqueue.test.ts`.
- [ ] `pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:migrate` against a disposable local DB — second run applies zero migrations (idempotency; NOT what `db:check-drift` checks — see Task 2's Step 1 correction).
- [ ] `pnpm db:check-drift` — verifies migration-ledger parity only (every file in `apps/api/migrations/` has one `breeze_migrations` row); run it because it's the standing gate for any new migration file, not because it proves schema correctness.
- [ ] Integration tests — run with NO `DATABASE_URL` override (the safe default in `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/setup.ts` already points at the dedicated test database, `postgresql://breeze_test:breeze_test@localhost:5433/breeze_test`; `apps/api/src/testUtils/integrationDatabaseSafety.ts` actively REFUSES a connection string on port 5432 or with a database name other than `breeze_test(_*)`, so the dev DB URL used elsewhere in this repo's docs must never be passed here):
  `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/backupRetentionPins.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/backupSnapshotRetirementsRls.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Contract suites this wave's registry edits are graded against (tenancy/cascade code was touched — run these before PR per CLAUDE.md):
  - `find apps/api/src -iname "tenantCascade*integration*"` then `npx vitest run <path>` against the same test DB (no `DATABASE_URL` override needed).
  - `apps/api/src/routes/devices/*.test.ts` matching `cascade`/`moveOrg` (both device-side lists fail in the unit job since they read the Drizzle schema statically — no live DB required).
  - `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry`'s check script/integration test (`grep -n check-tenant-export-policy apps/api/package.json` for the exact invocation) and `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts` + `tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts` (only fail under Integration Tests — run against the test DB before PR).
  - `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` — confirm it still passes with no new allowlist entry needed for shape-1 auto-discovery.
- [ ] `pnpm lint`
- [ ] **Explicitly out of scope, handed to W02:** pruning `backup_snapshot_retirements` rows 30 days after `swept_at` is set (spec §3.3: "Rows are pruned 30 d after `swept_at`"). This wave never sets `swept_at` at all (that's the GC sweep's job, §3.4/W02) and adds no pruning job — a pruning task only makes sense once W02's sweep is setting `swept_at` in the first place. W02's plan should include a `swept_at IS NOT NULL AND swept_at < now() - 30d` cleanup pass (a new scheduled job, or folded into the existing GC cadence) as one of its own tasks; it is NOT silently dropped here — call it out in that plan's own Consumes/Produces the same way this note does.
- [ ] PR body checklist:
  - [ ] Migrations `160201`/`160202` applied and idempotent-verified (`pnpm db:migrate` run twice locally, second run a no-op).
  - [ ] `pnpm db:check-drift` clean (ledger parity only — not a schema-correctness proof; see above).
  - [ ] Tenancy contract suites (cascade order, device cascade/denormalized lists, export-policy, rls-coverage) all green against the real test DB, not just the unit job.
  - [ ] `Closes #<W01 sub-issue>` once this feature is registered via `feature-lifecycle` (per CLAUDE.md's Feature Lifecycle Tracking section, if this plan is executed as a tracked wave).
  - [ ] Note for W02/W03 reviewers: `backupGcKnobs.ts` currently exports `BACKUP_BASE_LEASE_MS`, `BACKUP_RESTORE_PIN_LINGER_MS`, `BACKUP_PUBLISH_MARGIN_MS` — W02 is expected to migrate `BACKUP_GC_GRACE_MS`/`BACKUP_GC_MANIFESTLESS_PREFIX_MAX_AGE_MS`/a real `BACKUP_GC_ORPHAN_MANIFEST_MAX_AGE_MS` into this same module, delete the `RECONCILE_ORPHAN_HALF_WINDOW_MS` local literal in `backupSnapshotReconcile.ts` (Task 11), replace Task 8's single shared `runWithSystemDbAccess` wrap around `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects()` with genuinely separate per-identity contexts managed inside that function, and add the 30-day `backup_snapshot_retirements` pruning pass noted above.

## Open questions / contradictions — resolved by coordinator 2026-09-09

All eight items below were raised during drafting and have since been resolved by explicit coordinator decision; the plan text above already reflects each resolution. Kept here as a decision log, not as open items.

1. **RESOLVED — no backfill.** Migration `160201` is DDL only (Task 1): no PL/pgSQL port of `normalizeStorageIdentity`, no UPDATE, no `breeze.scope` elevation. Every `backup_snapshots.storage_identity` starts NULL; W02's sweep self-heals each row from a live bucket listing, matched by row id. The SQL-fidelity concerns that motivated the original open question (path/URL parsing divergence) no longer apply, since no SQL normalization is attempted here at all.
2. **CONFIRMED — asymmetry intentional.** `staleCommandReaper.ts`'s `RESTORE_COMMANDLESS_PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS` (Task 7) is a fixed 1 hour, independent of the env-tunable, 7-day-default `BACKUP_RESTORE_PIN_LINGER_MS` (Task 9) retention's own pin check uses. Coordinator confirms this is the intended operator-facing behavior, not an oversight.
3. **RESOLVED — import path.** `backupRetention.test.ts:34` mocks only `vi.mock('../db', () => ({ db: mockDb }))` — there is no mock on `'../db/schema'` in that file. Task 9 now imports `restoreJobs`/`backupSnapshotRetirements`/`IN_FLIGHT_BACKUP_JOB_STATUSES` from the barrel `'../db/schema'` (joining the file's existing barrel import), and `recoveryTokens` from the concrete `'../db/schema/recoveryTokens'` module (matching `backupWorker.ts`'s existing convention for that specific table). Tasks 6/10/11 were also normalized to add `backupSnapshotRetirements` to each file's existing barrel import rather than a separate `'../db/schema/backup'` line.
4. **ACCEPTED — N+1 query shape.** Task 11's base-existence check re-queries the DB per adopted candidate; accepted as consistent with `reconcileOrphanedBackupSnapshots`'s existing per-candidate DB-read pattern. Flagged for a future pass only if reconcile's throughput over a large orphan backlog becomes a real bottleneck — not addressed in this wave.
5. **RESOLVED — width.** `BACKUP_SNAPSHOT_ID_MAX_LENGTH = 200` (confirmed, `apps/api/src/db/schema/backupConstants.ts`), matching `backup_jobs.snapshot_id`'s existing `varchar(200)` (`apps/api/src/db/schema/backup.ts:247`). Task 3's migration now uses `varchar(200)` for `backup_snapshot_retirements.snapshot_id` (was `varchar(255)`); Task 2's Drizzle schema already used the `BACKUP_SNAPSHOT_ID_MAX_LENGTH` constant directly and needed no change. `backup_jobs.base_snapshot_id` (Task 1) deliberately stays `varchar(255)` per the spec's own explicit choice for that column — the two widths are independent.
6. **ACCEPTED — noted, not fixed.** Task 6's sequential per-target base selection in a multi-target dispatch could theoretically let two sibling targets pin the same base snapshot. Coordinator confirms this is fine as-is (harmless: both dispatch normally, retention just sees two pins instead of one) — left as a noted, unverified-as-impossible edge case, not a defect requiring a fix.
7. **RESOLVED — import.** Confirmed by reading `apps/api/src/routes/backup/configs.ts`'s import block directly: `backupSnapshots` was NOT already imported (only `backupConfigs`, from `'../db/schema'` at line 13). Task 12 now widens that same import line.
8. **RESOLVED — always include `warnings`.** Per coordinator decision, `PATCH /backup/configs/:id`'s response always includes `warnings: string[]` (empty array when there's nothing to warn about), not an optional field. Task 12's implementation and tests were updated accordingly.

## Round-2 review findings — all fixed in the plan text above

An independent review pass found the following defects; each is fixed in place (not merely noted) in the tasks above.

9. **FIXED — retention never invents an identity.** `unknown::<uuid>` is removed entirely (Task 9); a row with `storageIdentity IS NULL` is skipped and counted as a new `skippedUnresolved` counter, retried on a later run.
10. **FIXED — legal hold/immutability re-read under the lock.** Moved from the enumeration pass into `deleteSnapshotRow` itself, decided from the `FOR UPDATE`-locked row (Task 9); the enumeration selects no longer fetch or branch on those columns at all.
11. **FIXED — identity-scoped snapshot_id lookups.** `backup_snapshots.snapshot_id` has no uniqueness constraint (`schema/backup.ts:330`). Every lookup that matches a row by that bare string is now also scoped by `storageIdentity`: retention's backup-pin check (Task 9), the late-result fence's base lookup (Task 10), the `parentSnapshotId` lookup (Task 10, also switched from `configId` to `storageIdentity` scoping), and reconcile's base-existence check (Task 11).
12. **FIXED — §3.7 sweep call shape corrected.** Task 8 wraps `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects()` in exactly ONE `runWithSystemDbAccess` call (not bare/depth-0, superseding an earlier, since-corrected instruction) so its existing GUC-dependent reads keep working; W02 replaces the single wrap with genuine per-identity contexts.
13. **FIXED — queue schema propagation (P1).** `queueSchemas.ts`'s `.strict()` `backupSnapshotSummarySchema` and `backupEnqueue.ts`'s `ProcessResultsResult.snapshot` interface both widened to carry `baseSnapshotId`/`formatVersion`/`backupIdentity`, with a round-trip regression test (Task 10).
14. **FIXED — dispatch lock query (P1).** The outer-joined `FOR SHARE` (rejected by Postgres — `FOR UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE` cannot apply to the nullable side of an outer join) is split into two statements: `FOR SHARE` on `backup_snapshots` alone, then a plain (unlocked) SELECT against `backup_snapshot_retirements` (Task 6).
15. **FIXED — rejection branch device predicate (P1).** The late-result fence's SELECT and UPDATE are both scoped by `(id, deviceId)`, matching the file's own #3036 convention at the main UPDATE (Task 10) — never by job id alone.
16. **FIXED — late-result fence atomicity + NULL lease (P1).** The whole check-and-write sequence runs inside one `db.transaction` with `FOR UPDATE` on the job row (atomic against the reaper); a NULL `publishLeaseExpiresAt` is now a REJECT (`publish_lease_expired`), not an implicit pass (Task 10). Reconcile additionally refuses to adopt a job whose late result was already fenced (new `'late-result-fenced'` skip reason, Task 11).
17. **FIXED — hyperv/mssql identity stamping (P2).** `stampDispatchPinAndIdentity` is now called for every dispatched target; `storage_identity` is stamped unconditionally, while `publish_lease_expires_at`/`base_snapshot_id` remain file/system_image-only (Task 6).
18. **FIXED — discriminating test assertions (P2).** Task 10's tests now assert the actual captured `parentSnapshotId`/`isIncremental`/`storageIdentity`/`errorLog` values, not `applied === true` alone. Task 13 gained: restore pin with/without `command_id`, recovery-token pin, max-versions-respects-pins, a real-DB late-result-lease-expired case, a two-path concurrent dispatch-vs-retention race, and a `processCleanupExpiredSnapshots` (worker-handler-level) proof of §6(6b).
19. **FIXED — compile/setup issues (P2).** `sql` added to `backupRetention.ts`'s widened `drizzle-orm` import (Task 9); the RLS forge test's `DbAccessContext` shape corrected to the real interface (no `partnerId` field) using the established `orgContext` helper convention, with the SQLSTATE assertion corrected to read `.cause.code` for a Drizzle insert (Task 13); all integration-test run commands now use the safe default test DB instead of the dev DB URl, which `testUtils/integrationDatabaseSafety.ts` actively refuses (Tasks 13-14).
20. **FIXED — migration verification claims (P2).** A Drizzle partial index matching migration `160201`'s `backup_jobs_base_snapshot_id_idx` was added to Task 2's schema edit (previously missing). The plan no longer claims `pnpm db:check-drift` compares the Drizzle schema to a live database — `scripts/check-drift.ts` verifies migration-ledger parity only; a `pnpm db:migrate` run-twice idempotency check was added instead (Tasks 2, 14). The 30-day `backup_snapshot_retirements` pruning pass (spec §3.3) is explicitly handed to W02 (Task 14's Produces/handoff note), since this wave never sets `swept_at` in the first place.

## W02 handoff note (§3.7 call-shape contract — corrected by coordinator's second review pass)

Task 8 makes `processCleanupExpiredSnapshots` call `await runWithSystemDbAccess(() => sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects())` — **ONE shared context for the whole sweep**, opened strictly AFTER every row's retention has already committed independently (Task 9). This matches today's read shape exactly, so `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects`'s existing internal `db.select(...)` calls keep the working GUCs they rely on (it has no context management of its own — Ground Truth, `backupRetention.ts:982`) — no interim regression is introduced. W02 is expected to replace this single shared wrap with genuinely separate per-identity contexts managed INSIDE `sweepUnreferencedBackupObjects` itself (spec §3.7 item 2: "a separate system context per identity for the DB reads, with every storage call at depth 0"), at which point this call site's wrap is removed entirely and W02 should not need to touch `backupWorker.ts` again beyond that one deletion.

An earlier draft of this plan had this call site bare (no context at all) per an initial, since-superseded coordinator instruction; that was corrected back to the single-wrap shape described above after independent review flagged it would leave the sweep's reads genuinely broken (not merely under-optimized) until W02 landed. The single-wrap shape is the final, authoritative one.
