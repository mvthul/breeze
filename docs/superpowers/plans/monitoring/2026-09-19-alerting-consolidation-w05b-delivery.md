# Alerting Consolidation — W05b Delivery Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Every notification traces to one delivery decision a technician can read on screen: one resolver (`resolveDelivery`) used by the dispatcher, by the monitor editor's Notify preview and by an AI tool; an explicit, editable "Everything else" routing row per partner (and optionally per org) replaces the hidden all-enabled-channels fallback; routing rows gain `monitorKinds` and an escalation policy; escalation policies get CRUD; `/alerts/delivery` replaces `/alerts/channels`.

**Architecture:** A pure-ish service module `services/delivery/resolveDelivery.ts` owns the precedence (monitor none → monitor channels → transitional legacy override → routing rows → org default row → partner default row → none) and is the only place that reads `notification_routing_rules` for a delivery decision. The dispatcher (`notificationDispatcher.ts`) builds a `ResolveDeliveryInput` from the alert and calls it; `GET /alerts/delivery/resolve` calls it under the request's RLS context; the `manage_delivery` AI tool calls it too. A migration writes the default rows from the exact current fallback query so day one is behavior-identical, and from then on a new channel is opt-in. The web `/alerts/delivery` page composes three list sections (Channels · Routing · Escalation policies), each saved through a row drawer via `runAction`.

**Tech Stack:** Hono + Drizzle + Zod (API), hand-written SQL migration, Vitest (unit, RLS, integration against real Postgres via `pnpm test-stack up`), Astro + React + react-i18next (web, 8 locales), Starlight MDX (docs).

**Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-19-alerting-consolidation-design.md — §End state "Navigation" (tab strip), §End state "Monitors" (Notify card), §End state "Delivery", §Data model "Routing", §Delivery resolution (all of it, including "Transitional" and "Migration"), §Tenancy and safety (default rows dual-owned, write-coverage allowlists), §AI / MCP tools (`manage_notification_channels` row), §Docs and release notes, §Waves W05b row.

## Ordering assumptions (read first)

1. **Base:** `main` at `b8dd148bd8` or later. All file:line references below were verified against that commit on 2026-09-19; re-verify with `rg -n` before editing if the base has moved.
2. **W05a is independent and may land before or after this wave.** Two touch points overlap:
   - W05a removes `conditionTypes`/`deviceTags` from `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.ts:26-45`. Task 3 below writes the *end-state* schema (severities + monitorKinds + siteIds, `.strict()`), so it is correct whether W05a landed first or not. If W05a landed, the diff is smaller; do not re-add the fields.
   - W05a deletes the `/monitoring/*` redirect stubs, including `apps/web/src/pages/monitoring/delivery.astro` (today: `return Astro.redirect('/alerts/channels');` — a 302, not 301). Task 9: if the file still exists, repoint it to `/alerts/delivery`; if W05a deleted it, skip.
3. **W05c1 depends on this wave** for: `resolveDelivery` (D6: the converter compares resolved eligible channels AND escalation before/after for every affected device/site, including kind-less legacy → kind-specific routing; delivery rails/channels/policies participate in preview freshness), `notification_routing_rules.escalation_policy_id`, and the `legacy_override` branch (W05c1 Task 8 adds `retired_at IS NULL` to BOTH Task 4 lookups (`alertRules` and `configPolicyAlertRules`) and tests dispatch queued before retirement; W05d removes the override and every `legacyEscalation` fallback, description, and test branch). Keep the exported names exactly as in **Interfaces** — W05c1/W05c2/W05d import them.
4. **Three PRs, in order.** PR 1 (Tasks 1–8) is API-only and ships the migration; PR 2 (Tasks 9–12) is the web page and redirects and can be reviewed in parallel but must merge after PR 1 (the routing drawer posts `monitorKinds`/`escalationPolicyId`, which PR 1's schema accepts); PR 3 (Tasks 13–16) adds the preview endpoint, Notify card, AI tool and docs, and extends PR 1's integration suite to the spec gate. Task 17 is the verification pass run before *each* PR.
5. **The spec gate** ("one integration test proving dispatch and preview agree for org-row, partner-row, default-row and inbox-only cases against real Postgres") is `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts`: created in Task 7 (dispatcher ⇄ resolver), extended in Task 13 (⇄ endpoint). The migration-replay half of the gate is `deliveryDefaultRowsMigration.integration.test.ts` (Task 1). Write/run Task 7’s Step 1 gate before implementing Tasks 2/4, then return to Task 7 for its green pass; task numbers and PR boundaries stay unchanged.
6. **Prerequisite defects #6342/#6343/#6344 do not gate this wave** (they gate W05c).
7. **D21 supersedes D1’s skip vocabulary and DB eligibility boundary.** The additive SELECT-only partner branches for channels, routing and escalation already shipped in `2026-10-10-120000-notification-maintenance-partner-wide-select.sql:75-90`; `PARTNER_WIDE_SELECT_BRANCH_EXEMPT` is empty in `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`. W05b adds no policy and changes no RLS allowlist. Resolver and inherited-rail services use their supplied executor under its existing context.

## Global Constraints

- **D27.** The step field is `renotify`; UI copy may still say “repeat”. `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` treats object-literal `repeat` fields as BullMQ registrations without an allowlist. Shared step schemas/types live in the Zod-only `services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts`, re-exported by route schemas; services never import routes. API and web both enforce integer `delayMinutes` 1..10080. Every PR gate runs the full API unit suite (`cd apps/api && npx vitest run`), including schedule-registry and worker-entrypoint contracts. Any integration test that seeds a notification channel and expects delivery must also seed a matching routing row or an Everything else row; the all-enabled-channel fallback is gone.

- **D22–D26 (2026-09-19 review amendments).** Escalation order is monitor (unless delivery mode is `none`) → unretired legacy source → winning row → null; W05d removes only the legacy arm. The partner default is permanent; an org default is a removable governance-protected override. Writes use Task 5 bounds (ten steps, fifty occurrences); stored data uses Task 6 tolerant parsing and Task 12 coercion. Task 6's caller-aware user selection applies to HTTP, web and AI alike — **product owner confirmation pending** (HO-20260919-alerting-consolidation Q1). Warn on skipped channels with alert/org/source/rule/reasons, log skipped escalation users and missing transport options, and schedule escalation even with no initial channels.

- **Tenancy (CLAUDE.md "Tenant Isolation / RLS", "Partner-Wide First").** No new tables. `notification_routing_rules` gains two columns on a table already registered in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` (`services/tenantCascade.ts:579`) and `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` (`services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:404`). **The export-policy row fires on a new column:** both `escalation_policy_id` and `is_default` must be added to the `included` bucket in the same PR (Task 1) or `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts` goes red under Integration Tests. RLS on the table is unchanged: `notification_routing_rules_isolation` (FOR ALL, `2026-07-01-notification-rails-partner-ownership.sql`) plus the SELECT-only partner-wide branch `notification_routing_rules_partner_wide_select` (`2026-10-10-120000-notification-maintenance-partner-wide-select.sql`). The branch is what lets an org token's preview endpoint see the partner's "Everything else" row — do not escalate to system context in the route.
- **Migration rules (CLAUDE.md "Schema Migration Workflow").** File `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-23-100000-delivery-routing-default-rows.sql` (assigned name; newest shipped at planning time is `2026-10-21-110100-…`). **Before pushing, run `git fetch origin && git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations | grep -E '^apps/api/migrations/[0-9]{4}-[^/]+\.sql$' | sort | tail -1` and run `scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main`; rename if anything newer landed.** Idempotent (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS` guards on every INSERT); no inner `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`; elect system scope in the migration's first statement solely for its row writes and counts (FORCE RLS otherwise denies those writes; enforced by `apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts`); every write reports `GET DIAGNOSTICS ... ROW_COUNT` via `RAISE WARNING` so the counts land in Postgres logs (spec: "Report both counts"). Never edit it after it ships.
- **D21 delivery boundary.** Runtime code never elevates its own scope. Ordinary RLS-scoped executor reads and the same explicit owner predicate apply in system dispatch and org preview: `channel.orgId === input.orgId || (channel.orgId === null && channel.partnerId === orgPartnerId)` (a null org partner never matches). Only visible, owner-valid, enabled channels enter `channelIds`; others have `disabled` or `unavailable` skip reasons. Check ownership before enabled state; missing, foreign and invisible IDs are indistinguishable. Inherited rails use service-level column projections for the exact Task 8 DTOs, never whole-row redaction. Moving channel configuration to an RLS-protected child table is tracked separately and out of scope. The migration’s row-write scope election is the sole exception to runtime scope preservation.
- **Write-coverage contract tests.** `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` is textual: any file under `src/routes/**` or `src/services/**` that mutates a partner-axis table must mention `canManagePartnerWidePolicies`. The new writers (`services/delivery/routingRuleWrites.ts`, `services/aiToolsDelivery.ts`) gate partner-wide writes on that helper themselves, so no allowlist entry is needed; if the test still flags a file, gate it — do not allowlist. `site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts` names `notificationChannels` but not routing rules/escalation policies; the AI tool gates mutations on `canMutateOrgWideGovernance` anyway (same posture as `manage_notification_channels`).
- **Web mutations go through `runAction`** (`apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`); catch pattern per CLAUDE.md. `no-silent-mutations.test.ts` guards this.
- **Web i18n.** Every new key needs real translations in all eight locale folders: `en`, `de-DE`, `es-419`, `fr-CA`, `fr-FR`, `it-IT`, `pt-BR`, `tr-TR` (`apps/web/src/locales/`). Parity is enforced; per-locale/namespace duplicate caps live in `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts` — if a new value trips a cap, translate it instead of bumping the cap. PR description must carry the two machine-draft lines from `apps/web/src/locales/README.md`.
- **Settings rules (CLAUDE.md "Settings — one concept, one home").** Delivery is edited in one place: `/alerts/delivery`. Routing/escalation are lists → row-drawer Save; channels keep their existing modal (unchanged component). The Notify card *shows* the resolved inherited value and where it comes from (rule 4) and links to `/alerts/delivery`; it never edits routing. PR descriptions for PR 2 and PR 3 state: home `/alerts/delivery`, levels partner default → org override, resolver `resolveDelivery`, places configured before = 2 (`/alerts/channels` page + monitor editor override), after = 2 (same two, one resolver).
- **Test commands.** Focused development unit checks: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`; every PR gate: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run`; web: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run <path>`; integration: `pnpm test-stack up` once, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts <path>`; `pnpm test-stack down` when finished. Never `pnpm --filter X test -- --run` (the `--` breaks vitest). Path filters are substring matches — list dotted siblings explicitly.
- **File size.** `notificationDispatcher.ts` is 1587 lines, `NotificationChannelsPage.tsx` 928, `aiToolsAlerts.ts` 677. New code goes in new files (`services/delivery/*`, `components/alerts/delivery/*`, `aiToolsDelivery.ts`); the dispatcher and the alerts tool file only shrink.

## File Structure (what changes where)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-23-100000-delivery-routing-default-rows.sql` | **Create.** Columns, partial unique indexes, warning counts and default rows only; no new policies or eligibility routine. |

## PR 1 — API: migration, resolver, dispatcher (Tasks 1–8)

### Task 1: Routing columns + default-row migration + export policy + replay test

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-23-100000-delivery-routing-default-rows.sql`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/db/schema/alerts.ts:228-243` (`notificationRoutingRules`), the `drizzle-orm` import at the top of that file (add `sql` if absent)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:404`
- Test: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryDefaultRowsMigration.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (DB): `notification_routing_rules.escalation_policy_id uuid NULL REFERENCES escalation_policies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, `notification_routing_rules.is_default boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`, partial unique indexes `notification_routing_rules_org_default_uidx (org_id) WHERE is_default AND partner_id IS NULL` and `notification_routing_rules_partner_default_uidx (partner_id) WHERE is_default AND org_id IS NULL`.
- Produces (Drizzle): `notificationRoutingRules.escalationPolicyId`, `notificationRoutingRules.isDefault`, `conditions` typed as `RoutingRuleConditions = { severities?: string[]; monitorKinds?: string[]; siteIds?: string[] }` (exported from the schema file).
- Consumes: `2026-07-01-notification-rails-partner-ownership.sql` (the XOR CHECK and FOR ALL policy), `notificationDispatcher.ts:362-371` (the fallback query this migration reproduces).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryDefaultRowsMigration.integration.test.ts`

```ts
/**
 * Replays 2026-10-23-100000-delivery-routing-default-rows.sql against a
 * fixture partner and asserts the rows it writes equal the PRE-migration
 * all-enabled-channels fallback (notificationDispatcher.ts:362-371 on main
 * at b8dd148bd8): org's enabled channels + its partner's enabled partner-wide
 * channels, `enabled = true` on both axes. This is the "day one is
 * behavior-identical" half of the W05b spec gate.
 *
 * CI databases are migrated schema-fresh in globalSetup, so the file's
 * data-moving DO blocks otherwise run against zero rows; this suite seeds
 * the real pre-migration shape and re-runs the file from disk.

-- Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-19-alerting-consolidation-design.md
--       §Data model "Routing", §Delivery resolution "Migration".
--
-- SYSTEM SCOPE IS ELECTED FIRST AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING. notification_routing_rules
-- is FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY with one FOR ALL policy
-- (2026-07-01-notification-rails-partner-ownership.sql). Without this line the
-- count SELECT reads zero rows and the INSERTs abort with 42501. `is_local => true`
-- scopes it to autoMigrate's per-file transaction. Enforced by
-- apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts.
--
-- The two INSERTs reproduce EXACTLY the fallback query the dispatcher ran on
-- main@b8dd148bd8 (notificationDispatcher.ts:362-371): railOwnershipCondition
-- (org_id = O OR (org_id IS NULL AND partner_id = O.partner_id)) AND enabled = true.
-- Day one is behavior-identical; from then on a new channel is opt-in.
--
-- Idempotent: IF NOT EXISTS everywhere, NOT EXISTS guards on both INSERTs.
-- No inner BEGIN/COMMIT (autoMigrate wraps each file). Counts RAISE WARNING so
-- they land in Postgres logs (log_min_messages defaults to warning).

Drizzle schema (`apps/api/src/db/schema/alerts.ts`, replace the `notificationRoutingRules` block at lines 228-243; ensure `sql` is imported from `drizzle-orm` and `uniqueIndex` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` — both already appear in this file):

Export policy (`tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:404`, one line):

```ts

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```bash

All green. If `db:check-drift` reports the partial index predicate text, adjust the migration's `WHERE` clause to the exact text drizzle-kit renders (quoting only) — never the other way round once shipped.

### Task 2: `railOwnership.ts` + `resolveDelivery.ts` with unit tests

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/railOwnership.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.ts`
- Test: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (cross-wave contract, exact names — W05c1/W05c2/W05d import these):
  ```ts
  export type DeliverySource = 'monitor_none' | 'monitor_channels' | 'legacy_override' | 'routing_rule' | 'default_row' | 'none';
  export interface ResolveDeliveryInput { orgId: string; severity: AlertSeverity; monitorId?: string | null; kind?: MonitorKind | null; siteId?: string | null; legacyOverride?: { channelIds?: string[] | null; escalationPolicyId?: string | null } | null; }
  export interface ResolvedDelivery { channelIds: string[]; skippedChannelIds: Array<{ id: string; reason: 'disabled' | 'unavailable' }>; escalationPolicyId: string | null; source: DeliverySource; routingRuleId?: string; routingRuleName?: string; }
  export async function resolveDelivery(input: ResolveDeliveryInput, executor?: DbExecutor): Promise<ResolvedDelivery>;
  export function routingRuleMatches(conditions: RoutingRuleConditions | null | undefined, facts: { severity: string; kind: string | null; siteId: string | null }): boolean;
  export function orderRoutingRows<T extends { isDefault: boolean; priority: number; orgId: string | null }>(rows: T[]): T[];
  ```
  `DbExecutor` = `typeof db | Parameters<Parameters<typeof db.transaction>[0]>[0]` (same local alias as `monitorResolver.ts:71`; not exported by `db/index.ts`).
- Produces: `railOwnership.ts` → `partnerIdForOrg(orgId, executor?)`, `railOwnershipCondition(orgCol, partnerCol, orgId, orgPartnerId)` (bodies moved verbatim from `notificationDispatcher.ts:134-160`).
- Consumes: ordinary RLS-scoped reads on the supplied `DbExecutor`; `notificationChannels`, `notificationRoutingRules`, `monitorDefinitions`, `organizations` (schema), `AlertSeverity` from `@breeze/shared` (`packages/shared/src/types/index.ts:498`), `MonitorKind` from `@breeze/shared` (`packages/shared/src/validators/monitors.ts:41`).

Precedence (spec §Delivery resolution), first hit wins:
1. monitor `deliveryMode = 'none'` → `[]`, `monitor_none`, escalation **null** (spec: monitor escalation applies only when mode ≠ none).
2. monitor `deliveryMode = 'channels'` → its channels, `monitor_channels`, escalation = monitor's ?? unretired legacy source's ?? null (there is no winning routing row in this short-circuit).
3. transitional legacy override with ≥1 channel → `legacy_override`, escalation = monitor's ?? override's.
4. routing rows: `enabled`, non-default first, `priority ASC`, org rows before partner rows at equal priority; match `severities` / `monitorKinds` / `siteIds`; **site and kind both fail closed** (a kind-scoped row never catches a kind-less alert; today's site semantics unchanged). Rows with no channels are skipped (API forbids them for non-default rows).
5. org `is_default` row, else partner `is_default` row → `default_row` (channels may be `[]` = inbox only). Escalation = monitor's ?? unretired legacy source's ?? row's ?? null.
6. nothing → `[]`, `none`, escalation = monitor's ?? override's.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.test.ts`

```ts
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

// Same select-queue harness as notificationDispatcher.routingSites.test.ts:
// each `db.select()` chain resolves to the next queued array.
const { selectQueue, channelRows } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  selectQueue: [] as unknown[][],
  channelRows: [] as Array<{ id: string; orgId: string | null; partnerId: string | null; enabled: boolean }>,
}));

  const { notificationChannels } = await import('../../db/schema');

 * disagree, deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts is the proof.
 *
 * Precedence, first hit wins:
 *   1. monitor deliveryMode 'none'      → inbox only            (monitor_none)
 *   2. monitor deliveryMode 'channels'  → monitor's channels    (monitor_channels)
 *   3. legacy override with channels    → those channels        (legacy_override)  [W05b→W05d]
 *   4. first matching routing row       → row's channels        (routing_rule)
 *   5. org is_default row, else partner is_default row          (default_row)
 *   6. nothing                          → inbox only            (none)
 * Escalation resolves independently: monitor's (mode ≠ none) ?? unretired legacy source's

### Task 3: Routing API — `monitorKinds`, `escalationPolicyId`, the "Everything else" row rules

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/routingRuleWrites.ts` (+ `routingRuleWrites.test.ts`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.ts:17-47` (schemas), `:230-380` (POST/PATCH/DELETE bodies), new `PUT /routing-rules/default`
- Test: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.defaultRow.test.ts`; existing `routing.writes.test.ts`, `routing.authz.test.ts`, `routing.siteScope.test.ts`, `routing.list.test.ts` must stay green

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (`routingRuleWrites.ts`):
  ```ts
  export const DEFAULT_ROW_NAME = 'Everything else';
  export const DEFAULT_ROW_PRIORITY = 1000000;
  export type RoutingOwner = { orgId: string | null; partnerId: string | null };
  export class DeliveryWriteError extends Error { constructor(public readonly status: 400 | 403 | 404 | 409, message: string) }
  export function assertDefaultRowPatch(updates: Record<string, unknown>): void; // throws DeliveryWriteError(400)
  export async function escalationPolicyCompatible(policyId: string, owner: RoutingOwner, executor?: DbExecutor): Promise<boolean>;
  export async function upsertDefaultRow(owner: RoutingOwner, data: { channelIds: string[]; escalationPolicyId: string | null }, auth: Pick<AuthContext, 'scope' | 'allowedSiteIds' | 'allowedDeviceIds'> & Partial<Pick<AuthContext, 'partnerId' | 'partnerOrgAccess' | 'canAccessOrg'>>, executor?: DbExecutor): Promise<typeof notificationRoutingRules.$inferSelect>;
  ```
- Produces (HTTP): `POST /alerts/routing-rules` accepts `conditions: { severities?, monitorKinds?, siteIds? }` (strict — `conditionTypes`/`deviceTags` → 400) and `escalationPolicyId?: uuid | null`; `PATCH /alerts/routing-rules/:id` on an `isDefault` row requires `canMutateOrgWideGovernance(auth)` and accepts only `channelIds` (may be `[]`) and `escalationPolicyId`; `DELETE` of a partner `isDefault` row → 409; deleting an org default requires `canMutateOrgWideGovernance(auth)` and restores partner inheritance; `PUT /alerts/routing-rules/default` `{ ownerScope?: 'organization' | 'partner', channelIds: uuid[], escalationPolicyId?: uuid | null }` (+ `?orgId=` for partner/system callers) upserts the axis's row → 200 `{ data: row }`.
- Consumes: `monitorKindSchema` (`@breeze/shared`), `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` / `PARTNER_WIDE_WRITE_DENIED_MESSAGE` (`services/partnerWideAccess.ts`), `resolveWriteOrgId`, `ensureOrgAccess` (`routes/alerts/helpers.ts:52,77`), `partnerIdForOrg` (Task 2).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```
If `routing.writes.test.ts`'s schema mock (`vi.mock('../../db/schema', () => ({ notificationRoutingRules: {...} }))`) now throws because `routingRuleWrites.ts` imports `escalationPolicies`, add `escalationPolicies: { id: {}, orgId: {}, partnerId: {} }, organizations: { id: {}, partnerId: {} }` to that mock — no behavior change.

### Task 4: Dispatcher on the resolver; delete the all-channels fallback

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts` — imports (`:9-45`), delete `partnerIdForOrg`/`railOwnershipCondition` (`:126-160`), replace `:264-376` and `:441-446`, delete `resolveRoutingRules` (`:1245-1300`)
- Move+rewrite: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.routingSites.test.ts` → `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.sites.test.ts`
- Modify: all existing `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher*.test.ts` (UUID fixture normalization); `notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts:148-249`, `notificationDispatcher.configPolicyOverrides.test.ts:143-214`, `notificationDispatcher.orderingGuards.test.ts` (six 6-entry queues), `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts:384-407`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `resolveDelivery`, `partnerIdForOrg`, `railOwnershipCondition` (Task 2).
- Produces: unchanged export surface except `resolveRoutingRules` is **removed** (grep confirms its only consumer is the routingSites test). `processAlertNotifications` return shape unchanged.
- Select order after this task (every mock-based test depends on it):
  1. `alerts` by id · 2. `devices` by id · 3. `alertRules` `{overrideSettings, managedByMonitorId}` if `alert.ruleId`, else `configPolicyAlertRules` if `alert.configPolicyId`, else nothing · 4. `organizations` (dispatcher's `partnerIdForOrg`) · 5. `organizations` (resolver's `partnerIdForOrg`) · 6. `monitorDefinitions` if a monitorId resolved (`alert.monitorId ?? rule.managedByMonitorId`) · 7. `notificationRoutingRules` unless steps 1–3 of the precedence short-circuited · 7b. `notificationChannels` eligibility metadata (ordinary SELECT under the supplied context); 8. `notificationChannels` transport options if eligible channels resolved · 9. `escalationPolicies` + `notificationChannels` if an escalation policy resolved.
  The second `organizations` read is deliberate: the resolver owns its own lookup so the preview endpoint and the AI tool need no caller-side plumbing; one PK read per dispatch is the price of one contract.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests** — rewrite the affected cases first.

Strict persisted-step parsing in Task 6 uses the real UUID validator. Before applying the snippets, replace the legacy fixture channel strings throughout the existing dispatcher test files (including expected job IDs) using this implementation-time script:

```python
from pathlib import Path
ids = {'mc1': 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000011',
       'c1': 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000012',
       'channel-1': 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000013',
       'org-default-channel': 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000014'}
for path in Path('apps/api/src/services').glob('notificationDispatcher*.test.ts'):
    text = path.read_text()
    for old, new in ids.items():
        text = text.replace(old, new)
    path.write_text(text)
```

In all three existing dispatcher suites add `channelEligibilityMock: vi.fn()` to the hoisted state. Extend their existing `db.select` factory to distinguish Task 2's eligibility projection from the later transport SELECT. Retain the existing select queue for all other reads:

```ts
// In the existing db mock factory: accept `fields` in select's callback and,
// before building the queued chain, add this branch. This still mocks SELECT.
select: vi.fn((fields?: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  if (fields && 'enabled' in fields && 'orgId' in fields && 'partnerId' in fields) {
    return { from: () => ({ where: () => channelEligibilityMock() }) };
  }
  return makeSelect(); // the suite's existing thenable queue-chain factory
}),
// In each beforeEach, independently reset the eligibility fixtures:
channelEligibilityMock.mockReset().mockResolvedValue(
  ['aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000011', 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000012', 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000013', 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000014']
    .map(id => ({ id, orgId: 'org-1', partnerId: null, enabled: true })),
);
```

`notificationDispatcher.orderingGuards.test.ts:337-349`'s `queueEscalationFlow` also needs the resolver organization lookup before its channel-options lookup; its unmanaged override means no routing read. Keep webhook transport metadata in the subsequent options fixture.


`apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.sites.test.ts` (replaces the routingSites suite; same harness as Task 2's test):

```ts
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

  const { notificationChannels } = await import('../../db/schema');

      then: (resolve: (v: unknown) => unknown) => Promise.resolve(isChannelRead ? channelRows : selectQueue.shift() ?? []).then(resolve),
    };
    return chain;
  };
  return { db: { select: vi.fn(() => makeSelect()) } };

`notificationDispatcher.orderingGuards.test.ts` — every 6-entry baseline queue (`:157-164`, `:183-190`, `:209-216`, `:229-236`, `:290-297`) currently reads `alert, device, org, [] routing, [{id:'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000013'}] fallback, validChannels`. Replace each with `alert, device, ORG_LOOKUP, ORG_LOOKUP, [DEFAULT_ROW_C1], validChannels` where, added once near the helpers:

```ts
const ORG_LOOKUP = [{ partnerId: null }];
const DEFAULT_ROW_C1 = {
  id: 'default-row', orgId: 'org-1', partnerId: null, name: 'Everything else', priority: 1000000,
  conditions: {}, channelIds: ['aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000013'], enabled: true, escalationPolicyId: null, isDefault: true,
};
```
(The `:229-236` case keeps its webhook `validChannels` entry `[{ id: 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000013', type: 'webhook', config }]`.) Expectations are unchanged.

`notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts:384-407` — retitle and seed the partner's default row:

```ts
  it("a partner-wide Everything else row delivers member-org alerts only (the no-rules fallback is gone)", async () => {
    const partnerA = await createPartner();
    const partnerB = await createPartner();
    const orgA = await createOrganization({ partnerId: partnerA.id });
    const orgB = await createOrganization({ partnerId: partnerB.id });

    const deviceA = await seedDevice(orgA.id, 'rail-fallback-a');
    const deviceB = await seedDevice(orgB.id, 'rail-fallback-b');
    const alertA = await seedAlert(orgA.id, deviceA);
    const alertB = await seedAlert(orgB.id, deviceB);

    // Partner A has a partner-wide channel AND its Everything else row
    // (what the W05b migration writes for it). No other rules anywhere.
    const channelA = await seedPartnerChannel(partnerA.id);
    const [defaultA] = await withDbAccessContext(partnerContext(partnerA.id, []), () =>
      db.insert(notificationRoutingRules).values({
        orgId: null, partnerId: partnerA.id, name: 'Everything else', priority: 1000000,
        conditions: {}, channelIds: [channelA], enabled: true, isDefault: true,
      }).returning(),
    );
    createdRules.push(defaultA!.id);

    const resultA = await withDbAccessContext(SYSTEM_CTX, () =>
      processAlertNotifications({ type: 'process-alert', alertId: alertA }),
    );
    expect(resultA.queued).toBe(1); // the default row found the partner-wide channel

    const resultB = await withDbAccessContext(SYSTEM_CTX, () =>
      processAlertNotifications({ type: 'process-alert', alertId: alertB }),
    );
    expect(resultB.queued).toBe(0); // another partner's row NEVER leaks in; no row → inbox only
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.sites.test.ts src/services/notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts src/services/notificationDispatcher.configPolicyOverrides.test.ts src/services/notificationDispatcher.orderingGuards.test.ts
```
Expected: the new monitorDelivery/configPolicyOverrides cases fail on `queued` counts (old code consumes the queue in the old order and hits the fallback); `resolveDelivery.sites` passes already (it only needs Task 2) — that is fine, it is the moved suite.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — `notificationDispatcher.ts`:

(a) Imports: add
```ts
import { resolveDelivery } from './delivery/resolveDelivery';
import { partnerIdForOrg, railOwnershipCondition } from './delivery/railOwnership';
```
remove `notificationRoutingRules`, `monitorDefinitions` from the `../db/schema` import and `asc`, `isNull`, `or`, `Column` from the `drizzle-orm` import if nothing else in the file uses them (tsc/eslint `no-unused-vars` will say). Delete the local `partnerIdForOrg` and `railOwnershipCondition` definitions (`:126-160`) and their doc comment.

(b) Replace `:264-376` (from `// Get notification channels — from rule overrides or org defaults` through the `if (channelIds.length === 0) { ... return ... }` that follows the fallback) with:

```ts
  // ONE delivery decision (W05b, spec §Delivery resolution). resolveDelivery is
  // shared with GET /alerts/delivery/resolve, so what the monitor editor
  // previews is what fires here. The all-enabled-channels fallback is gone: the
  // "Everything else" routing row is the default a technician can read.
  let monitorId: string | null = alert.monitorId ?? null;
  let legacyOverride: { channelIds?: string[] | null; escalationPolicyId?: string | null } | null = null;

  if (alert.ruleId) {
    const [rule] = await db
      .select({ overrideSettings: alertRules.overrideSettings, managedByMonitorId: alertRules.managedByMonitorId })
      .from(alertRules)
      .where(eq(alertRules.id, alert.ruleId))
      .limit(1);
    if (rule) {
      monitorId = monitorId ?? rule.managedByMonitorId ?? null;
      if (!rule.managedByMonitorId) {
        // Transitional (spec §Delivery resolution "Transitional", W05b → W05d):
        // an UNMANAGED legacy rule keeps its own channel/escalation overrides
        // until it is converted. W05c adds `retired_at IS NULL` to this lookup;
        // W05c1 Task 8 covers BOTH legacy lookups with a queued-dispatch regression.
        // W05d deletes the branch. A MANAGED (monitor-compiled) rule is never
        // read for delivery — the monitor definition is the source of truth.
        const overrides = (rule.overrideSettings ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>;
        legacyOverride = {
          channelIds: Array.isArray(overrides.notificationChannelIds) ? (overrides.notificationChannelIds as string[]) : null,
          escalationPolicyId: typeof overrides.escalationPolicyId === 'string' ? overrides.escalationPolicyId : null,
        };
      }
    }
  } else if (alert.configPolicyId) {
    // Config-policy inline rule (#5289 Task 9): `configPolicyId` holds the
    // config_policy_alert_rules row id (historical column name). Same
    // transitional treatment as an unmanaged alert_rules row. W05c1 Task 8 adds
    // isNull(configPolicyAlertRules.retiredAt) here, alongside alertRules.retiredAt above.
    const [cpRule] = await db
      .select({
        escalationPolicyId: configPolicyAlertRules.escalationPolicyId,
        notificationChannelIds: configPolicyAlertRules.notificationChannelIds
      })
      .from(configPolicyAlertRules)
      .where(eq(configPolicyAlertRules.id, alert.configPolicyId))
      .limit(1);
    if (cpRule) {
      legacyOverride = { channelIds: cpRule.notificationChannelIds ?? null, escalationPolicyId: cpRule.escalationPolicyId ?? null };
    }
  }

  // Dual-axis rail resolution (#2130): the alert org's partner, for the
  // channel validation and escalation lookups below.
  const orgPartnerId = await partnerIdForOrg(alert.orgId);

  const resolved = await resolveDelivery({
    orgId: alert.orgId,
    severity: alert.severity as AlertSeverity,
    monitorId,
    siteId: device?.siteId ?? null,
    legacyOverride
  });

  // Escalation resolves independently of channels (spec): "inbox now, page
  // on-call in 30 minutes" is a valid configuration, so schedule it whether or
  // not a baseline send goes out.
  const scheduleResolvedEscalation = async () => {
    if (resolved.escalationPolicyId) {
      await scheduleEscalation(data.alertId, resolved.escalationPolicyId, alert.orgId, orgPartnerId);
    }
  };

  if (resolved.skippedChannelIds.length) {
    console.warn('[NotificationDispatcher] Skipped delivery channels', {
      alertId: data.alertId, orgId: alert.orgId, source: resolved.source,
      ruleId: alert.ruleId, routingRuleId: resolved.routingRuleId, skippedChannelIds: resolved.skippedChannelIds,
    });
  }
  let channelIds = resolved.channelIds;
  if (channelIds.length === 0) {
    console.log(`[NotificationDispatcher] Delivery for alert ${data.alertId} resolved to inbox only (source=${resolved.source})`);
    await scheduleResolvedEscalation();
    return { queued: 0, inAppSent, durationMs: Date.now() - startTime };
  }
```

(c) Replace `:378-400` (the second eligibility filter and its early returns). Eligibility belongs solely to the resolver. Load transport options for those IDs, then map the jobs over `channelIds` (not query results), preserving `retryIfFailedJob`, baseline job IDs and the retry options:

```ts
const channelOptions = await db.select({ id: notificationChannels.id, type: notificationChannels.type, config: notificationChannels.config })
  .from(notificationChannels).where(inArray(notificationChannels.id, channelIds));
const optionsById = new Map(channelOptions.map(channel => [channel.id, channel]));
const validChannels = channelIds.flatMap(id => {
  const options = optionsById.get(id);
  if (options) return [options];
  console.warn('[NotificationDispatcher] Missing transport options', { alertId: data.alertId, orgId: alert.orgId, channelId: id });
  return [];
});
```

A transport-options miss is dropped and logged; it never invents an unknown transport. There is no second eligibility filter or post-filter early return, including when every transport-options read misses. The zero-channel branch above **always** calls `scheduleResolvedEscalation`; retain the mandatory disabled-channel regression in Task 17 as a PR-1 gate. The send worker still checks live state at egress to handle changes after resolution. Replace `:441-446` with:

```ts
await scheduleResolvedEscalation();
```

(d) Delete `resolveRoutingRules` (`:1245-1300`, including its doc comment) and `git rm apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.routingSites.test.ts` (its replacement is `services/delivery/resolveDelivery.sites.test.ts`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery src/services/notificationDispatcher && npx tsc --noEmit -p .)
if rg -n "resolveRoutingRules" apps/api/src; then
  echo "Stale resolver reference remains" >&2
  exit 1
fi
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher*.test.ts apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.sites.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts
git rm apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.routingSites.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): dispatcher delivers through resolveDelivery; all-channels fallback deleted (W05b)"
```

### Task 5: Typed escalation-policy steps

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts` (Zod only)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts:180-191`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.authz.test.ts:175,187` (fixtures `steps: []` → one valid step)
- Test: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.steps.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces in `services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts` (re-exported by `routes/alerts/schemas.ts`): `export const escalationStepSchema: z.ZodType<EscalationStep>; EscalationStep = { delayMinutes: number; channelIds: string[]; userIds: string[]; renotify?: { everyMinutes: number; maxTimes: number } }`; `createPolicySchema.steps` = shared `escalationStepsSchema` (1..10 steps and at most 50 total occurrences); `updatePolicySchema.steps` = same, optional. Exported `EscalationStep` type.
- D23/D27: each step has integer `delayMinutes` in 1..10080 and at least one channel/user target. A policy has 1..10 steps; `renotify.everyMinutes` is integer 1..1440 and `maxTimes` is integer 1..10 **additional** sends after the first. The sum of `1 + (renotify?.maxTimes ?? 0)` across steps is at most 50. All delays are absolute from initial scheduling; acknowledgements/resolution cancel every occurrence. User targets create deduplicated in-app notifications. The execution task below implements these fields in PR 1; Task 12 exposes them in PR 2.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.steps.test.ts`

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';

    }
  });

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/alerts/policies.steps.test.ts
```
Expected: `escalationStepSchema` is not exported; `steps: []` parses successfully today (`z.any()`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — `apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts` owns the schemas and type, with Zod as its only import. Services must never import from `routes/` (`workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts`).

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const escalationStepSchema = z.object({
  delayMinutes: z.number().int().min(1).max(10080),
  channelIds: z.array(z.string().guid()).max(100).default([]),
  userIds: z.array(z.string().guid()).max(100).default([]),
  renotify: z.object({ everyMinutes: z.number().int().min(1).max(1440),
    maxTimes: z.number().int().min(1).max(10) }).strict().optional(),
}).strict().refine(step => step.channelIds.length + step.userIds.length > 0, 'At least one target is required');
export type EscalationStep = z.infer<typeof escalationStepSchema>;
export const escalationStepsSchema = z.array(escalationStepSchema).min(1).max(10)
  .refine(steps => steps.reduce((total, step) => total + 1 + (step.renotify?.maxTimes ?? 0), 0) <= 50,
    'At most 50 escalation occurrences are allowed');
```

In `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts:180-191`, import the policy-array schema and re-export the shared schemas/type:

```ts
import { escalationStepsSchema } from '../../services/delivery/escalationSteps';
export { escalationStepSchema, escalationStepsSchema, type EscalationStep } from '../../services/delivery/escalationSteps';

export const createPolicySchema = z.object({
  orgId: z.string().guid().optional(),
  // 'partner' creates a partner-wide ("all orgs") escalation policy (#2130).
  ownerScope: z.enum(['organization', 'partner']).optional(),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  steps: escalationStepsSchema
});

export const updatePolicySchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(255).optional(),
  steps: escalationStepsSchema.optional()
});
```
`policies.authz.test.ts:175,187`: `steps: []` → `steps: [{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: ['9a8b7c6d-2222-4333-8444-555566667777'] }]`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/alerts/policies
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.steps.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.authz.test.ts

### Task 6: Execute user escalation targets and bounded repeats (PR 1)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationExecution.ts`, `escalationExecution.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts:85-124,1306-1427` (job union/worker, scheduling, cancellation)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.ts:157-165,210-229` (validate targets before insert/update)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts:28-61` (queue cancellation mock)
- Read: `apps/api/src/services/notificationSenders/inAppSender.ts:65-105,178-218`, `apps/api/src/db/schema/users.ts:132-153`, `apps/api/src/db/schema/notifications.ts:33-67`. The existing targeted sender has no dedupe key; the new executor uses the existing unique `(user_id,dedupe_key)` index instead.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes Task 5 `escalationStepSchema` and `EscalationStep` directly from `services/delivery/escalationSteps.ts` (never the route re-export); existing channel `processSendNotification` durable status/dedupe guard.
- Produces `parseStoredEscalationSteps(raw, policyId)` (non-throwing, original indexes), `escalationOccurrences(steps)` (50-occurrence cap), `listEscalationUsers(owner, auth, executor?)` (picker), `listEligibleEscalationRecipients(owner, executor?)` (delivery), `validateEscalationUsers(steps, owner, auth, existingSteps?, executor?)`, `processUserEscalation(data, executor?)`; `UserEscalationJob = { type: 'escalation-user'; alertId; userId; escalationStep: number }`.
- **D25 — product owner confirmation pending** (HO-20260919-alerting-consolidation Q1): recipients for org O are active unrestricted O members or active users of O’s partner with all-org access or selected access including O. Validate targets on writes and re-filter against the alert org at fire time. Org callers may see/newly add only O members; previously stored partner-picked IDs survive edits. Partner/system callers may also pick partner users; partner-wide policies list every active partner user regardless of org access.
- First occurrence keeps existing `escalationStep = index + 1`; repeat r uses `r * 10 + index + 1` (at most ten steps). Thus old pending channel jobs retain identity and each repeat gets a different durable send identity. `maxTimes` counts additional sends; delay is `delayMinutes + r * everyMinutes` from scheduling. User notifications have no external egress and commit in the background worker’s existing short system transaction; the service requires that transaction and never changes the caller’s scope.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts
// escalationExecution.test.ts
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
const state = vi.hoisted(() => ({ rows: [] as unknown[][], values: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('../../db', () => ({
  db: {
    select: () => { const q: any = { from: () => q, where: () => q, limit: () => q, for: () => q,
      then: (ok: any, bad: any) => Promise.resolve(state.rows.shift() ?? []).then(ok, bad) }; return q; },
    execute: async () => state.rows.shift() ?? [],
    insert: () => ({ values: (v: unknown) => { state.values(v); return { onConflictDoNothing: async () => [] }; } }),
  },
  assertInTransaction: vi.fn(),
}));
import { assertInTransaction } from '../../db';
import { escalationOccurrences, processUserEscalation, validateEscalationUsers } from './escalationExecution';
beforeEach(() => { state.rows.length = 0; vi.clearAllMocks(); });
it('keeps old step IDs and allocates unique repeat identities at exact delays', () => {
  expect(escalationOccurrences([{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: ['ch'], userIds: ['u'], renotify: { everyMinutes: 10, maxTimes: 2 } }])
    .map(o => [o.escalationStep, o.delayMs])).toEqual([[1, 300000], [11, 900000], [21, 1500000]]);
});
it.each(['acknowledged', 'resolved', 'suppressed', 'dismissed'])('does not notify after %s, including jobs already active', async status => {
  state.rows.push([{ id: 'a', orgId: 'o', status }]);
  await processUserEscalation({ type: 'escalation-user', alertId: 'a', userId: 'u', escalationStep: 11 });
  expect(state.values).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it('uses an occurrence-specific durable key and does not conflate baseline in-app notices', async () => {
  state.rows.push([{ id: 'a', orgId: 'o', status: 'active', title: 'CPU', message: 'High', severity: 'high' }],
    [{ partnerId: 'p' }], [{ id: 'u', name: 'Alex' }]);
  await processUserEscalation({ type: 'escalation-user', alertId: 'a', userId: 'u', escalationStep: 11 });
  expect(state.values).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ userId: 'u', orgId: 'o', dedupeKey: 'escalation:a:11:u' }));
});
it('requires an existing transaction instead of changing scope itself', async () => {
  vi.mocked(assertInTransaction).mockImplementationOnce(() => { throw new Error('transaction required'); });
  await expect(processUserEscalation({ type: 'escalation-user', alertId: 'a', userId: 'u', escalationStep: 1 }))
    .rejects.toThrow('transaction required');
  expect(state.values).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it('rejects missing/foreign targets before policy writes', async () => {
  state.rows.push([{ partnerId: 'p' }], []);
  await expect(validateEscalationUsers([{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: [], userIds: ['foreign'] }],
    { orgId: 'o', partnerId: null }, { scope: 'partner' } as any)).rejects.toMatchObject({ status: 400 });
});
it('drops a user who lost membership before execution', async () => {
  state.rows.push([{ id: 'a', orgId: 'o', status: 'active' }], [{ partnerId: 'p' }], []);
  await processUserEscalation({ type: 'escalation-user', alertId: 'a', userId: 'u', escalationStep: 1 });
  expect(state.values).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

In `notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts` extend the hoisted state with `queueDelayedMock: vi.fn()`; use `getDelayed = queueDelayedMock` in its Queue mock, reset it to `mockResolvedValue([])` in `beforeEach`, import `cancelAlertEscalations`, then add:

```ts
it('cancels channel and user repetitions but leaves baseline jobs alone', async () => {
  const jobs = [
    { type: 'send', alertId: 'alert-1', channelId: 'c', escalationStep: 11 },
    { type: 'escalation-user', alertId: 'alert-1', userId: 'u', escalationStep: 21 },
    { type: 'send', alertId: 'alert-1', channelId: 'c' },
  ].map(data => ({ data, remove: vi.fn(async () => {}) }));
  queueDelayedMock.mockResolvedValue(jobs);
  expect(await cancelAlertEscalations('alert-1')).toBe(2);
  expect(jobs[2]!.remove).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

D23/D25/D26 required regressions: parse `[invalid, valid]` and retain original step index 1 (first job step 2), warn with dropped indexes, accept a non-array as no valid steps without throwing, and clamp valid stored repeats to 50 occurrences. Test caller scope separately from delivery eligibility: org callers reject newly supplied partner-user IDs but preserve IDs read from the existing policy; partner/system callers may select eligible partner users; a partner-wide picker includes active selected-org users. At fire time test inactive/restricted org members, removed membership and selected-org exclusion; each skipped user is logged. Keep recipient filtering tied to the alert org, never merely the policy owner.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery/escalationExecution.test.ts src/services/notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts)
```

    dedupeKey: `escalation:${alert.id}:${data.escalationStep}:${data.userId}`,
  }).onConflictDoNothing();
}

```

Parse stored steps individually (older rows omit `userIds`): import `parseStoredEscalationSteps` into the dispatcher; in `scheduleEscalation`, replace the type assertion with:

```ts
const steps = parseStoredEscalationSteps(policy.steps, policy.id);
// Malformed stored steps never abort dispatch; valid steps keep original indexes.
```

Import `escalationOccurrences`, `listEligibleEscalationRecipients`, `processUserEscalation`, and `UserEscalationJob`. Add `UserEscalationJob` to `NotificationJobData` and this worker case:

```ts
case 'escalation-user': {
  // Background entry point establishes the same context as process-alert.
  const userJob = job.data;
  return runWithSystemDbAccess(() => processUserEscalation(userJob));
}
```

Keep the existing enabled/owner-scoped escalation-channel query and retry handling. Replace the outer `for (let i = 0; i < steps.length; i++)` scheduling loop with the following; first-channel job IDs stay byte-compatible with existing queued jobs:

```ts
const requestedUsers = steps.some(step => step.userIds.length > 0);
const eligibleUsers = new Set(requestedUsers
  ? (await listEligibleEscalationRecipients({ orgId, partnerId: null })).map(user => user.id) : []);
for (const step of escalationOccurrences(steps)) {
  for (const channelId of [...new Set(step.channelIds)].filter(id => validChannelIdSet.has(id))) {
    const channel = validChannelById.get(channelId)!;
    const job = await queue.add('send', { type: 'send', alertId, channelId, escalationStep: step.escalationStep }, {
      delay: step.delayMs, jobId: `escalation-${alertId}-step${step.escalationStep}-${channelId}`,
      attempts: notificationJobAttempts(channel.type, channel.config),
      backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 30000 }, removeOnComplete: true, removeOnFail: { age: 3600 },
    });
    await retryIfFailedJob(job, `alert ${alertId} escalation step ${step.escalationStep}`);
  }
  for (const userId of [...new Set(step.userIds)]) {
    if (!eligibleUsers.has(userId)) {
      console.warn('[Escalation] Skipped user target', { alertId, orgId, userId, escalationStep: step.escalationStep });
      continue;
    }
    const job = await queue.add('escalation-user', { type: 'escalation-user', alertId, userId, escalationStep: step.escalationStep }, {
      delay: step.delayMs, jobId: `escalation-${alertId}-step${step.escalationStep}-user-${userId}`,
      attempts: 3, backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 30000 }, removeOnComplete: true, removeOnFail: { age: 3600 },
    });
    await retryIfFailedJob(job, `alert ${alertId} user escalation ${step.escalationStep}`);
  }
}
```

In `cancelAlertEscalations`, replace its condition with:

```ts
if ((job.data.type === 'send' || job.data.type === 'escalation-user') &&
    job.data.alertId === alertId && job.data.escalationStep) {
  await job.remove(); cancelled++;
}
```

In `policies.ts` import `validateEscalationUsers`, `DeliveryWriteError`, `canMutateOrgWideGovernance`, `SITE_CEILING_WRITE_DENIED_MESSAGE`. Add the governance guard before any POST/PUT/DELETE write, and insert this before POST's insert and PUT's update respectively (owner for PUT is `{ orgId: policy.orgId, partnerId: policy.partnerId }`):

```ts
if (!canMutateOrgWideGovernance(auth)) return c.json({ error: SITE_CEILING_WRITE_DENIED_MESSAGE }, 403);
try {
  if (data.steps) await validateEscalationUsers(data.steps, owner, auth, existingSteps);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof DeliveryWriteError) return c.json({ error: error.message }, error.status);
  throw error;
}
```

Set `existingSteps = []` for POST and `existingSteps = policy.steps` for PUT; the latter comes from the stored row, never the request. For the PUT snippet, declare the immutable owner immediately after its existing `getEscalationPolicyWithOrgCheck`/partner-capability guard:

```ts
const owner = { orgId: policy.orgId, partnerId: policy.partnerId };
```

Keep the channel write validation already specified for routing/AI; additionally call `validateEscalationUsers(data.steps, owner, auth)` on AI create and `validateEscalationUsers(data.steps, owner, auth, row.steps)` on AI update in Task 15. `policies.authz.test.ts` keeps channel-only fixtures; no target-user query occurs for them. For DELETE use only the governance guard, since there is no `data.steps`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery/escalationExecution.test.ts src/services/notificationDispatcher src/routes/alerts/policies)
```
Expected: precise occurrence timing/identity, cancellation, current-membership and inactive-status regressions pass. Existing channel escalation retry/dedupe tests remain green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationExecution.ts apps/api/src/services/delivery/escalationExecution.test.ts apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/policies.ts

### Task 7: Integration gate (part 1) — dispatcher ⇄ resolver on real Postgres

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `processAlertNotifications` (system context), `resolveDelivery`, fixtures via `./db-utils` (`createPartner`, `createOrganization`), direct inserts under `withDbAccessContext` as in `notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts:106-160, 285-326`.
- Extended in Task 13 with the endpoint leg (same file, same fixtures).

```ts
/**
 * W05b spec gate: the dispatcher and the resolver (and, from Task 13, the
 * preview endpoint) agree for the org-row, partner-row, default-row and
 * inbox-only cases against real Postgres with the breeze_app role's RLS.
 *
 * Fixture: partner P with an enabled partner-wide channel; org O under P with
 * an enabled org channel, one site, one device at that site.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL** (execute this red gate before Tasks 2 and 4; confirm all six initial cases execute, 0 skipped (Task 8 adds the inherited-rails route case before PR 1), with `DATABASE_URL` set):

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts
```
Before Tasks 2 and 4, module discovery or decision assertions fail; the inbox-only case exposes the old fallback. Record that red result before implementing those tasks. The explicit owner predicate must also reject foreign IDs in system context, where RLS alone does not hide them. Task 13 adds the HTTP preview leg to these same fixtures.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — nothing beyond Tasks 1–5 and Task 6; if a case fails, the resolver or the dispatcher is wrong, not the test.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS** — same command; then the whole PR-1 surface:

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery src/services/notificationDispatcher src/routes/alerts/routing src/routes/alerts/policies src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts src/__tests__/site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(api): delivery resolution gate — dispatcher and resolver agree on real Postgres (W05b)"
```
After Task 8 and Task 17 verification, open PR 1. PR 1 body: `Closes` nothing yet (the wave closes on PR 3); state the migration name check was re-run against `origin/main`; release-notes line: *New notification channels are not subscribed to anything until added to a routing row; existing behavior is preserved by the "Everything else" rows the migration writes.*

### Task 8: Read inherited partner rails without granting partner writes (PR 1)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/deliveryRails.ts`, `deliveryRails.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/inheritedRails.ts`, `inheritedRails.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/index.ts:8-21` (mount before catch-all)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.ts:58-93` (export `routingSiteIds` and `canAccessRoutingSites`, bodies unchanged; PR 1 owns these exports)
- Read: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/channels.ts:59-68,92-97`, `policies.ts:35-39`, `routing.ts:135-139`, `helpers.ts:52-113,435-447`, `services/notificationChannelSecrets.ts` (`redactNotificationChannelConfig`). Existing administrative list/by-ID endpoints keep their write-access restrictions.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces `GET /alerts/delivery/rails?rail=channels|routing|escalation|users&orgId=<uuid>&ownerScope=partner|organization`. Channels return `{ data: editableChannels, inherited: InheritedChannel[] }`; routing/escalation return `{ data: Array<EditableRow | InheritedDTO> }`. Users retain `{ data: UserChoice[] }`.
- User picker and validation follow Task 6’s D25 recipient/caller distinction (**product owner confirmation pending**): org callers only see org members, partner/system callers also see eligible partner users, and partner-wide policies expose every active partner user regardless of org access. Add route tests for all three lists and for org-token denial of partner selection.
- Org callers are pinned to their org. Partner/system callers with orgId get that org plus its actual parent partner, never a caller-supplied partner ID. Without orgId, partner scope reads its own editable rails only. `ownerScope=partner` is accepted only for users and partner/system principals with a partner ID.
- Service-level column projection produces exactly these inherited DTOs: channels `{ id, name, type, enabled, inherited: true }`; routing `{ id, name, priority, enabled, isDefault, conditions: { severities, monitorKinds, siteIds }, channelIds, escalationPolicyId, inherited: true }`; policies `{ id, name, stepCount, inherited: true }`. Inherited channels never select `config`, even for redaction. Policy step targets and user IDs never leave the database projection. Routing exposes only supported conditions and intersects site IDs with the selected org and caller's allowed sites; targeted rows with no visible sites and unrestricted rows for site-limited callers fail closed.
- Editable rows use their exact owner axis. Inherited reads use the supplied ordinary executor and an explicit `org_id IS NULL AND partner_id = <actual org parent>` predicate. Existing additive SELECT policies supply visibility; no new policy, allowlist change, runtime elevation, or widened mutation permission. Existing own-channel redaction remains unchanged.

In `routing.ts`, add `export` to the existing `routingSiteIds` and `canAccessRoutingSites` declarations; keep their signatures and bodies unchanged. The unit harness above retains the real `siteAccessCheck` and supplies `requireMfa` because importing this module registers its existing routes.

          await canAccessRoutingSites(auth, { orgId: row.orgId, partnerId: row.partnerId }, routingSiteIds(row.conditions), false)
            ? row : null));
        return c.json({ data: [...visible.filter(row => row !== null), ...await inherited()] });
      }
      if (query.rail === 'escalation') {

      return c.json({
        data: rows.map(row => ({ ...row,
          config: redactNotificationChannelConfig(row.type, row.config) })),
        inherited: await inherited(),
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[DeliveryRails] Read failed', error);
      return c.json({ error: 'Failed to load delivery settings' }, 500);
    }
  });
```

Mount in `routes/alerts/index.ts` before `alertsRoutes`:

```ts
import { deliveryRailsRoutes } from './deliveryRails';
alertRoutes.route('/', deliveryRailsRoutes);
```

In Task 7's real-Postgres suite, import this router and add an HTTP fixture wrapper just like Task 13's `previewAs`, using the same real org `DbAccessContext` and middleware-only injection. This concrete regression belongs to PR 1 (use the imports/mock immediately below):

```ts
runDb('inherited rails stay readable under org RLS and exclude a foreign partner', async () => {
  const f = await seedFixture();
  await seedRule({ partnerId: f.partnerId, name: 'Inherited', channelIds: [f.partnerChannel] });
  const foreign = await createPartner();
  await seedRule({ partnerId: foreign.id, name: 'Foreign', channelIds: [f.partnerChannel] });
  const ctx: DbAccessContext = { scope: 'organization', orgId: f.orgId, accessibleOrgIds: [f.orgId],
    accessiblePartnerIds: [], currentPartnerId: f.partnerId, userId: null };
  const app = new Hono();
  app.use('*', async (c, next) => { c.set('auth', { scope: 'organization', orgId: f.orgId,
    partnerId: f.partnerId, canAccessOrg: (id: string) => id === f.orgId }); await next(); });
  app.route('/alerts', deliveryRailsRoutes);
  const response = await withDbAccessContext(ctx, () => app.request('/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=routing'));
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  const body = await response.json();
  expect(body.data.map((row: { name: string }) => row.name)).toEqual(['Inherited']);
  expect(body.data[0]).toMatchObject({ inherited: true });
  expect(Object.keys(body.data[0]).sort()).toEqual(['channelIds','conditions','enabled','escalationPolicyId','id','inherited','isDefault','name','priority']);
});
```

Add these imports and middleware-only mock when this integration case lands in PR 1; Task 13 reuses them:

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
// Reuse Task 7's existing vi import.
import { deliveryRailsRoutes } from '../../routes/alerts/deliveryRails';
vi.mock('../../middleware/auth', async importOriginal => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import('../../middleware/auth')>();
  return { ...actual,
    requireMfa: () => async (_c: any, next: any) => next(),
    requireScope: () => async (_c: any, next: any) => next(),
    requirePermission: () => async (_c: any, next: any) => next(),
  };
});
``` Retain existing `channels.authz`, `policies.authz`, and `routing.authz` suites: org writes/tests against partner-owned rows remain denied.

## PR 2 — Web: `/alerts/delivery` page and redirects (Tasks 9–12)

### Task 9: Tab strip `channels` → `delivery`, page + 301 stubs, page titles

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts:39,693` (one-for-one guard target replacement)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.tsx:6-12` (TABS), `:42-47` (activeHref)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx:20-36`
- Rename: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/NotificationChannelsPage.tsx` → `DeliveryPage.tsx`, and `NotificationChannelsPage.test.tsx` → `delivery/deliveryActions.test.ts` (repair relative imports and routing fixtures).
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/index.ts:45` (renamed page export)
- Create: `apps/web/src/pages/alerts/delivery.astro`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/pages/alerts/channels/index.astro` (→ 301 stub); Create: `apps/web/src/pages/alerts/routing-rules.astro` (301 stub)
- Modify (if present, see Ordering 2): `apps/web/src/pages/monitoring/delivery.astro`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertRuleForm.tsx:675` (`href="/alerts/delivery"`)
- Modify (8 locales): `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/alerts.json` `alertsTabStrip.tabs` (replace `channels` with `delivery`), `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/pages.json` `titles` (replace `alertsChannels` with `alertsDelivery`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: route `/alerts/delivery` rendering the renamed `DeliveryPage` (Step 3 preserves existing functionality; Task 11 adds the new composition), tab key `alertsTabStrip.tabs.delivery`, page title key `titles.alertsDelivery`.
- Consumes: `routeScope.ts:122` already classifies `/alerts(\/.*)?` as `org-or-all` — no change.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — replace `AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx:20-36`:

```ts
  it('localizes all alert section tabs in Brazilian Portuguese', async () => {
    await loadLocale('pt-BR');
    await act(() => i18n.changeLanguage('pt-BR'));

    render(<AlertsTabStrip />);

    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Alertas' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Correlações' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Monitores' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Regras' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Entrega' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.queryByRole('link', { name: 'Canais' })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('points the rules tab at the Legacy rules page (#5289) and the delivery tab at /alerts/delivery (W05b)', () => {
    render(<AlertsTabStrip />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Monitors' })).toHaveAttribute('href', '/alerts/monitors');
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Rules' })).toHaveAttribute('href', '/alerts/rules');
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Delivery' })).toHaveAttribute('href', '/alerts/delivery');
    expect(screen.queryByRole('link', { name: 'Channels' })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('marks the delivery tab active for /alerts/delivery and for the redirected legacy paths', () => {
    const { unmount } = render(<AlertsTabStrip currentPath="/alerts/delivery" />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Delivery' })).toHaveAttribute('aria-current', 'page');
    unmount();
    render(<AlertsTabStrip currentPath="/alerts/channels" />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Delivery' })).toHaveAttribute('aria-current', 'page');
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx
```
Expected: `Unable to find an accessible element with the role "link" and name "Delivery"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`AlertsTabStrip.tsx:6-12`:
```ts
const TABS = [
  { href: '/alerts', labelKey: 'alerts' },
  { href: '/alerts/correlations', labelKey: 'correlations' },
  { href: '/alerts/monitors', labelKey: 'monitors' },
  { href: '/alerts/rules', labelKey: 'rules' },
  { href: '/alerts/delivery', labelKey: 'delivery' },
] as const;
```
`:42-47`:
```ts
  const activeHref = useMemo(() => {
    if (path.startsWith('/alerts/correlations')) return '/alerts/correlations';
    // /alerts/channels and /alerts/routing-rules 301 to /alerts/delivery (W05b);
    // matching them here keeps the tab correct during the redirect paint.
    if (path.startsWith('/alerts/delivery') || path.startsWith('/alerts/channels') || path.startsWith('/alerts/routing-rules')) return '/alerts/delivery';
    if (path.startsWith('/alerts/monitors')) return '/alerts/monitors';
    if (path.startsWith('/alerts/rules')) return '/alerts/rules';
    return '/alerts';
  }, [path]);
```

`apps/web/src/pages/alerts/delivery.astro`:
```astro
---
import DashboardLayout from '../../layouts/DashboardLayout.astro';
import DeliveryPage from '../../components/alerts/DeliveryPage';
import Breadcrumbs from '../../components/layout/Breadcrumbs';
---

<DashboardLayout titleKey="titles.alertsDelivery">
  <Breadcrumbs client:load items={[
    { label: 'Alerts', href: '/alerts' },
    { label: 'Delivery' }
  ]} />
  <DeliveryPage client:load />
</DashboardLayout>
```
(Task 9 ships before Task 11 inside the same PR; to keep every commit green, in this commit create `apps/web/src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.tsx` as the *rename* of `NotificationChannelsPage.tsx` — `git mv`, then change the default export name, the `<AlertsTabStrip currentPath="/alerts/delivery" />` prop and the `h1` to `t('alertsTabStrip.tabs.delivery')` — and `git mv NotificationChannelsPage.test.tsx delivery/deliveryActions.test.ts` with its import path updated to `'../DeliveryPage'`. Task 11 then splits the file.)

The moved test retains every assertion and mock. Apply these exact import replacements (source `NotificationChannelsPage.test.tsx:5-29`), and add `escalationPolicyId: null` to its routing fixture at original line 170:

```ts
vi.mock('../NotificationChannelList', () => ({ default: () => null }));
vi.mock('../NotificationChannelForm', () => ({ default: () => null }));
vi.mock('../AlertsTabStrip', () => ({ default: () => null }));
// Preserve existing factories; replace their module specifiers:
// ../../stores/orgStore -> ../../../stores/orgStore
// ../../stores/auth -> ../../../stores/auth (mock AND import)
// ../shared/Toast -> ../../shared/Toast (mock AND import)
// ./NotificationChannelsPage -> ../DeliveryPage
```

In the guard's `TARGET_GLOBS` replace the old entry, keeping the count at 146:

```ts
'src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.tsx',
```

`apps/web/src/pages/alerts/channels/index.astro` (whole file):
```astro
---
// Channels moved into the Delivery facet (alerting consolidation W05b).
return Astro.redirect('/alerts/delivery', 301);
---
```
`apps/web/src/pages/alerts/routing-rules.astro` (whole file — this path never had a page; the spec names it so bookmarks to the API-shaped URL land somewhere):
```astro
---
// Routing lives on the Delivery page (alerting consolidation W05b).
return Astro.redirect('/alerts/delivery', 301);
---
```
`apps/web/src/pages/monitoring/delivery.astro` — only if it still exists: `return Astro.redirect('/alerts/delivery', 301);`.

`AlertRuleForm.tsx:675`: `href="/alerts/delivery"`.

`apps/web/src/components/alerts/index.ts:45`: `export { default as DeliveryPage } from './DeliveryPage';` (remove the `NotificationChannelsPage` line).

Locales — `alertsTabStrip.tabs`: delete the `"channels"` leaf and add `"delivery"` in every locale:

| locale | `tabs.delivery` | `titles.alertsDelivery` (pages.json, replaces `alertsChannels`) |
|---|---|---|
| en | Delivery | Alerts – Delivery |
| de-DE | Zustellung | Warnungen – Zustellung |
| es-419 | Entrega | Alertas – Entrega |
| fr-FR | Livraison | Alertes – Livraison |
| fr-CA | Livraison | Alertes – Livraison |
| it-IT | Consegna | Avvisi – Consegna |
| pt-BR | Entrega | Alertas – Entrega |
| tr-TR | Teslimat | Uyarılar – Teslimat |

Grep-check nothing else reads the removed keys: `grep -rn "alertsTabStrip.tabs.channels\|titles.alertsChannels" apps/web/src` must return nothing.

### Task 10: Independent delivery read states and Retry (PR 2)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.ts`, `useDeliveryResource.test.tsx`
- Consume: `apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts` (`fetchWithAuth`), `apps/web/src/lib/navigation.ts` (`navigateTo`), `apps/web/src/lib/asList.ts`; Task 11's page and Task 12's user picker use the hook.
- Read: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/NotificationChannelsPage.tsx:172-190` (current channel error handling). The review's inferred new routing/escalation failure is confirmed: existing GET handlers above return 500 on errors; treating their result as `[]` would fabricate a valid empty configuration.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces `useDeliveryResource<T>(url): { status: 'loading'|'error'|'success'; data: T[]; inherited: InheritedChannelChoice[]; reload(): void }`. Each rail has separate state, key, and retry. Stale responses cannot replace a newer org's data.
- A section with failed/loading prerequisites is not editable. Routing needs channels, routing and escalation reads; escalation needs channels and policy reads. Only a successful empty routing response synthesizes Inbox only. Other successfully loaded sections stay visible. GET query parameters are request facts, never browser UI state.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```tsx
import { act, renderHook, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
vi.mock('../../../stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('@/lib/navigation', () => ({ navigateTo: vi.fn() }));
import { fetchWithAuth } from '../../../stores/auth';
import { useDeliveryResource } from './useDeliveryResource';
const fetchMock = vi.mocked(fetchWithAuth);
const response = (body: unknown, status = 200) => ({ ok: status === 200, status, json: async () => body }) as Response;
beforeEach(() => vi.clearAllMocks());
it('errors are not successful empty lists; retry can produce a real empty list', async () => {
  fetchMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(response({ error: 'down' }, 500)).mockResolvedValueOnce(response({ data: [] }));
  const hook = renderHook(() => useDeliveryResource('/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=routing'));
  expect(hook.result.current.status).toBe('loading');
  await waitFor(() => expect(hook.result.current.status).toBe('error'));
  act(() => hook.result.current.reload());
  await waitFor(() => expect(hook.result.current.status).toBe('success'));
  expect(hook.result.current.data).toEqual([]);
});
it('ignores late results after changing org', async () => {
  let finish!: (res: Response) => void;
  fetchMock.mockImplementationOnce(() => new Promise(resolve => { finish = resolve; }))
    .mockResolvedValueOnce(response({ data: [{ id: 'new' }] }));
  const hook = renderHook(({ url }) => useDeliveryResource<{ id: string }>(url), { initialProps: { url: 'old' } });
  hook.rerender({ url: 'new' });
  await waitFor(() => expect(hook.result.current.data).toEqual([{ id: 'new' }]));
  await act(async () => finish(response({ data: [{ id: 'old' }] })));
  expect(hook.result.current.data).toEqual([{ id: 'new' }]);
});
it('preserves inherited channel enabled state without inventing config', async () => {
  const inherited = [{ id: 'partner', name: 'NOC', type: 'slack', enabled: false, inherited: true }];
  fetchMock.mockResolvedValueOnce(response({ data: [], inherited }));
  const hook = renderHook(() => useDeliveryResource('channels'));
  await waitFor(() => expect(hook.result.current.status).toBe('success'));
  expect(hook.result.current.inherited).toEqual(inherited);
  expect(hook.result.current.inherited[0]).not.toHaveProperty('config');
});
it('keeps unrelated rails usable', async () => {
  fetchMock.mockImplementation(async url => response({ data: [] }, url.includes('routing') ? 500 : 200));
  const hook = renderHook(() => ({ routing: useDeliveryResource('routing'), channels: useDeliveryResource('channels') }));
  await waitFor(() => expect(hook.result.current.routing.status).toBe('error'));
  expect(hook.result.current.channels.status).toBe('success');
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.test.tsx)
```
Expected: missing `./useDeliveryResource`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

```ts
// useDeliveryResource.ts
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { fetchWithAuth } from '../../../stores/auth';
import { navigateTo } from '@/lib/navigation';
export type ChannelChoice = { id: string; name: string; type: string; enabled: boolean; inherited?: true };
export type InheritedChannelChoice = ChannelChoice & { inherited: true };
type ReadState<T> = { key: string; status: 'loading'|'error'|'success'; data: T[]; inherited: InheritedChannelChoice[] };
export function useDeliveryResource<T>(url: string) {
  const [attempt, setAttempt] = useState(0);
  const [state, setState] = useState<ReadState<T>>({ key: '', status: 'loading', data: [], inherited: [] });
  const reload = useCallback(() => setAttempt(value => value + 1), []);
  useEffect(() => {
    let active = true;
    setState({ key: url, status: 'loading', data: [], inherited: [] });
    void fetchWithAuth(url).then(async response => {
      if (response.status === 401) { void navigateTo('/login', { replace: true }); throw new Error('unauthorized'); }
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('read failed');
      const body = await response.json();
      if (!Array.isArray(body.data)) throw new Error('invalid rail response');
      if (active) setState({ key: url, status: 'success', data: body.data, inherited: body.inherited ?? [] });
    }).catch(() => { if (active) setState({ key: url, status: 'error', data: [], inherited: [] }); });
    return () => { active = false; };
  }, [url, attempt]);
  const current: ReadState<T> = state.key === url ? state : { key: url, status: 'loading', data: [], inherited: [] };
  return { ...current, reload };
}
```

In Task 11 use the replacement page below from its first commit. In Task 12 the user picker invokes its own `useDeliveryResource<{id:string;name:string}>` with `rail=users` and the selected ownerScope; errors hide choices and disable Save, not clear saved target IDs. The exact new loading/error translations are supplied in Task 11; use `deliveryPage.loading`/`deliveryPage.loadFailed`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.test.tsx)
```
Expected: loading, independent error, retry and stale-result checks pass. Run the page regression after Task 11 supplies its composition.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.ts apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.test.tsx
git commit -m "fix(web): distinguish delivery read failures from empty settings (W05b)"
```

### Task 11: Delivery page — Channels · Routing (with the "Everything else" row) sections

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts:39,693` (one-for-one guard target replacement)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/deliveryActions.ts` (the five `run*` helpers moved verbatim from `DeliveryPage.tsx`, formerly `NotificationChannelsPage.tsx:19-114`, plus `runDefaultRowSave`); `deliveryActions.test.ts` (already moved in Task 9; imports switch to `'./deliveryActions'`; add cases)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/ChannelsSection.tsx` (the channel list + create/edit/delete modals + `transformFormToPayload`/`transformChannelToForm`, lifted verbatim from former `NotificationChannelsPage.tsx:132-470` and `:666-745`)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/RoutingSection.tsx`, `RoutingRuleDrawer.tsx`, `RoutingSection.test.tsx`
- Rewrite: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.tsx` (composition only)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.test.tsx` (independent read failure and retry regression)
- Modify (8 locales): `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/alerts.json` — new `deliveryPage` block

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  // deliveryActions.ts
  export type EditableRoutingRule = { id: string; orgId: string | null; partnerId: string | null; name: string; priority: number; conditions: { severities?: string[]; monitorKinds?: string[]; siteIds?: string[] }; channelIds: string[]; escalationPolicyId: string | null; enabled: boolean; isDefault: boolean; inherited?: false };
  export type InheritedRoutingRule = Omit<EditableRoutingRule, 'orgId' | 'partnerId' | 'inherited'> & { inherited: true };
  export type RoutingRule = EditableRoutingRule | InheritedRoutingRule;
  export const isEditableRoutingRule = (row: RoutingRule): row is EditableRoutingRule => row.inherited !== true;
  export const isPartnerRail = (row: RoutingRule | EscalationPolicy): boolean => row.inherited === true || row.orgId === null;
  export type EditableEscalationPolicy = { inherited?: false; id: string; orgId: string | null; partnerId: string | null; name: string; steps: Array<{ delayMinutes: number; channelIds: string[]; userIds?: string[]; renotify?: { everyMinutes: number; maxTimes: number } }> };
  export type InheritedEscalationPolicy = { id: string; name: string; stepCount: number; inherited: true };
  export type EscalationPolicy = EditableEscalationPolicy | InheritedEscalationPolicy;
  export const isEditableEscalationPolicy = (row: EscalationPolicy): row is EditableEscalationPolicy => row.inherited !== true;
  export async function runRoutingRuleSave(rule: Omit<EditableRoutingRule, 'id' | 'isDefault' | 'orgId' | 'partnerId' | 'inherited'> & { id?: string; ownerScope?: 'organization' | 'partner' }, deps): Promise<void>; // body now carries escalationPolicyId
  export async function runDefaultRowSave(data: { ownerScope?: 'organization' | 'partner'; channelIds: string[]; escalationPolicyId: string | null }, deps): Promise<void>; // PUT /alerts/routing-rules/default
  ```
- Consumes: `Drawer` (`components/shared/Drawer.tsx`), `ConfirmDialog`, `MONITOR_KINDS` (`@breeze/shared`) with labels `monitoring:kinds.<kind>`, sites via `GET /orgs/sites?organizationId=<id>&limit=100` (`asList(data, 'sites')`), `useDefaultOwnerScope`, `useOrgStore().currentOrgId`.
- View rules (spec §End state "Delivery" 2): non-default rows ordered by priority then org-before-partner; partner rows carry the `All orgs` badge and are editable only when `isPartnerScope`; the **Everything else** row is always rendered last. The partner row has no delete action; an editable org default offers **Use partner default**, gated by governance access and a confirmation naming the partner channels/escalation or inbox-only fallback. Empty channels show *Inbox only* while an independent escalation may still run; in an org view (`currentOrgId` set) the org row shadows the partner row — if only the partner row exists it renders read-only with **Customize for this organization**, explaining that the override stops following the partner default and can be removed later; in the all-orgs partner view the partner row is edited directly; when no row exists at all the page renders a synthesized *Inbox only* row whose Edit creates it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`deliveryActions.test.ts` — append:

```ts
describe('runDefaultRowSave (W05b)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => { vi.clearAllMocks(); });

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them, expect FAIL**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery
```
Expected: `Failed to resolve import "./deliveryActions"` / `"./RoutingSection"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `no-silent-mutations.test.ts` replace the Task 9 target with the final mutation owner (count remains 146):

```ts
'src/components/alerts/delivery/deliveryActions.ts',
```

`deliveryActions.ts` — move the five helpers verbatim (they already import `runAction`, `ActionError`, `showToast`, `i18n`, `fetchWithAuth`; fix the relative paths to `'../../../lib/runAction'`, `'../../shared/Toast'`, `'../../../lib/i18n'`, `'../../../stores/auth'`), add the types above, change `runRoutingRuleSave`'s body to include `escalationPolicyId: rule.escalationPolicyId ?? null`, and append:

```ts
export async function runDefaultRowSave(
  data: { ownerScope?: 'organization' | 'partner'; channelIds: string[]; escalationPolicyId: string | null },
  deps: { onUnauthorized: () => void }
): Promise<void> {
  await runAction({
    request: () => fetchWithAuth('/alerts/routing-rules/default', { method: 'PUT', body: JSON.stringify(data) }),
    successMessage: i18n.t('alerts:deliveryPage.routing.defaultSaved'),
    errorFallback: i18n.t('alerts:deliveryPage.routing.failedToSaveDefault'),
    onUnauthorized: deps.onUnauthorized,
  });
}

/** Mirrors services/delivery/resolveDelivery.ts orderRoutingRows — non-default first, priority ASC, org before partner. */
export function orderRoutingRules<T extends RoutingRule>(rules: T[]): T[] {
  return [...rules].sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.isDefault !== b.isDefault) return a.isDefault ? 1 : -1;
    if (a.priority !== b.priority) return a.priority - b.priority;
    return Number(isPartnerRail(a)) - Number(isPartnerRail(b));
  });
}
```

`ChannelsSection.tsx` — lift verbatim. Signature and the only new glue:

```tsx

type ModalMode = 'closed' | 'create' | 'edit' | 'delete';

export default function ChannelsSection({ channels, currentOrgId, isPartnerScope, defaultOwnerScope, onChanged, onUnauthorized }: {
  channels: NotificationChannel[];
  currentOrgId: string | null;
  isPartnerScope: boolean;
  defaultOwnerScope: 'organization' | 'partner';
  onChanged: () => Promise<void>;
  onUnauthorized: () => void;

  //   handleConfirmDelete: moved verbatim from the former
  //   NotificationChannelsPage.tsx:199-225,227-397,399-439 — every

Define `canMutateGovernance` in `DeliveryPage` and wire `RoutingSection.canMutateGovernance` from the existing caller-governance capability in `DeliveryPage`; never infer it from owner scope alone. Add localized keys in all eight locales: `usePartnerDefault` = “Use partner default”, `usePartnerDefaultConfirm` = “Remove this organization’s override and use {{fallback}}?”, and `customizeForOrgHint` = “This override stops following the partner default. Remove it later to inherit again.” Add web tests for confirm/cancel, DELETE via `runRoutingRuleDelete`/`runAction`, fallback channel and escalation names, missing-partner inbox fallback, partner row with no remove action, and governance-limited callers with no action.

`DeliveryPage.tsx` (rewritten; all three rails have independent state):

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import AlertsTabStrip from './AlertsTabStrip';
import type { NotificationChannel } from './NotificationChannelList';
import ChannelsSection from './delivery/ChannelsSection';
import RoutingSection from './delivery/RoutingSection';
import EscalationPoliciesSection from './delivery/EscalationPoliciesSection';
import type { EscalationPolicy, RoutingRule } from './delivery/deliveryActions';
import { useDeliveryResource } from './delivery/useDeliveryResource';
import { useOrgStore } from '../../stores/orgStore';
import { useDefaultOwnerScope } from '@/hooks/useDefaultOwnerScope';
import { navigateTo } from '@/lib/navigation';
import '../../lib/i18n';
export default function DeliveryPage() {
  const { t } = useTranslation('alerts');
  const { currentOrgId } = useOrgStore();
  const { isPartnerScope, defaultOwnerScope } = useDefaultOwnerScope();
  const suffix = currentOrgId ? `&orgId=${encodeURIComponent(currentOrgId)}` : '';
  const channels = useDeliveryResource<NotificationChannel>(`/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=channels${suffix}`);
  const routing = useDeliveryResource<RoutingRule>(`/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=routing${suffix}`);
  const policies = useDeliveryResource<EscalationPolicy>(`/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=escalation${suffix}`);
  const onUnauthorized = useCallback(() => { void navigateTo('/login', { replace: true }); }, []);
  const onChanged = async () => { channels.reload(); routing.reload(); policies.reload(); };
  const choices = [...channels.data.map(({ id, name, type, enabled }) => ({ id, name, type, enabled })), ...channels.inherited];
  const props = { currentOrgId, isPartnerScope, defaultOwnerScope, onChanged, onUnauthorized };
  const state = (resource: { status: string; reload: () => void }, key: string) => resource.status === 'error'
    ? <div role="alert" data-testid={`delivery-${key}-error`}>{t('deliveryPage.loadFailed')}
        <button type="button" onClick={resource.reload}>{t('common:actions.retry')}</button></div>
    : resource.status === 'loading' ? <p role="status">{t('deliveryPage.loading')}</p> : null;
  return <div className="space-y-8">
    <AlertsTabStrip currentPath="/alerts/delivery" />
    <h1>{t('deliveryPage.title')}</h1><p>{t('deliveryPage.subtitle')}</p>
    {state(channels, 'channels')}
    {channels.status === 'success' && <>
      <ChannelsSection {...props} channels={channels.data} />
      <ul data-testid="delivery-inherited-channels">{channels.inherited.map(channel => <li key={channel.id}>
        {channel.name} ({channel.type}) · {t('notificationChannelsPage.allOrgs')} · {t('deliveryPage.routing.partnerRowHint')}
      </li>)}</ul>
    </>}
    {state(routing, 'routing')}{state(policies, 'escalation')}
    {channels.status === 'success' && routing.status === 'success' && policies.status === 'success' &&
      <RoutingSection {...props} canMutateGovernance={canMutateGovernance} channels={choices} rules={routing.data} policies={policies.data} />}
    {channels.status === 'success' && policies.status === 'success' &&
      <EscalationPoliciesSection {...props} channels={choices} policies={policies.data} />}
  </div>;
}
```

Use `ChannelChoice[]` from `useDeliveryResource.ts` for the channel props of `RoutingSection`, `RoutingRuleDrawer`, `EscalationPoliciesSection`, and `EscalationPolicyDrawer`; `ChannelsSection` alone consumes full `NotificationChannel[]`. Never fabricate config fields for inherited channels or pass them to edit/test/delete controls. Use the `inherited` discriminant to narrow every row before reading owner IDs or steps. `canEditRow`/`canEdit` are type guards that first exclude inherited DTOs; only editable rows enter mutation drawers. Manage inherited partner rows from the partner view.

`DeliveryPage.test.tsx` (real page and independent fetches, minimal child stubs):

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { fireEvent, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
vi.mock('../../stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('../../stores/orgStore', () => ({ useOrgStore: () => ({ currentOrgId: 'org-1' }) }));
vi.mock('@/hooks/useDefaultOwnerScope', () => ({ useDefaultOwnerScope: () => ({ isPartnerScope: false, defaultOwnerScope: 'organization' }) }));
vi.mock('./AlertsTabStrip', () => ({ default: () => null }));
vi.mock('./delivery/ChannelsSection', () => ({ default: () => <div data-testid="channels-ready" /> }));
vi.mock('./delivery/RoutingSection', () => ({ default: () => <button data-testid="routing-default-edit">Edit</button> }));
vi.mock('./delivery/EscalationPoliciesSection', () => ({ default: () => <button data-testid="escalation-new">New</button> }));
import { fetchWithAuth } from '../../stores/auth';
import DeliveryPage from './DeliveryPage';
const fetchMock = vi.mocked(fetchWithAuth);
beforeEach(() => vi.clearAllMocks());
it.each(['routing','escalation'])('a failed %s read never offers an inbox-only default; Retry restores it', async rail => {
  let failed = true;
  fetchMock.mockImplementation(async url => ({ ok: !(failed && url.includes(`rail=${rail}`)), status: failed && url.includes(`rail=${rail}`) ? 500 : 200,
    json: async () => ({ data: [] }) }) as Response);
  render(<DeliveryPage />);
  await screen.findByTestId(`delivery-${rail}-error`);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('channels-ready')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('routing-default-edit')).toBeNull();
  if (rail === 'escalation') expect(screen.queryByTestId('escalation-new')).toBeNull();
  failed = false; fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Retry' }));
  expect(await screen.findByTestId('routing-default-edit')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

`EscalationPoliciesSection` is replaced in Task 12; this intermediate typed stub keeps Task 11 independently compilable:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
export default function EscalationPoliciesSection(_props: Record<string, unknown>) {
  const { t } = useTranslation('alerts');
  return <section><h2>{t('deliveryPage.sections.escalation')}</h2></section>;
}
```

### Task 12: Escalation policy CRUD on the Delivery page

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/EscalationPoliciesSection.tsx` (replaces the Task 11 stub), `EscalationPolicyDrawer.tsx`, `EscalationPoliciesSection.test.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/deliveryActions.ts` (+ `runEscalationPolicySave`, `runEscalationPolicyDelete`), `deliveryActions.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export async function runEscalationPolicySave(policy: { id?: string; name: string; steps: Array<{ delayMinutes: number; channelIds: string[]; userIds?: string[]; renotify?: { everyMinutes: number; maxTimes: number } }>; ownerScope?: 'organization' | 'partner'; orgId?: string | null }, deps): Promise<void>; // POST /alerts/policies | PUT /alerts/policies/:id
  export async function runEscalationPolicyDelete(policy: { id: string; name: string }, deps): Promise<void>; // DELETE /alerts/policies/:id
  ```
- Consumes: `POST /alerts/policies` (`policies.ts:113-186`, body `{ orgId?, ownerScope?, name, steps }`), `PUT /alerts/policies/:id` (`:189-241`), `DELETE /alerts/policies/:id` (`:244-273`). Note the policy routes return the bare row (`c.json(policy, 201)`), not `{ data }`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`deliveryActions.test.ts` — append:

```ts
describe('runEscalationPolicySave / runEscalationPolicyDelete (W05b)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => { vi.clearAllMocks(); });
  it('POSTs a new policy with ownerScope + orgId and toasts success', async () => {
    fetchWithAuthMock.mockResolvedValue(makeJsonResponse({ id: 'ep-new' }));
    await runEscalationPolicySave({ name: 'On-call', steps: [{ delayMinutes: 15, channelIds: ['ch-1'] }], ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: 'org-1' }, { onUnauthorized: ON_UNAUTHORIZED });
    expect(fetchWithAuthMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/alerts/policies', expect.objectContaining({ method: 'POST' }));
    expect(JSON.parse((fetchWithAuthMock.mock.calls[0]![1] as RequestInit).body as string)).toEqual({ name: 'On-call', steps: [{ delayMinutes: 15, channelIds: ['ch-1'] }], ownerScope: 'organization', orgId: 'org-1' });
    expect(showToastMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'success' }));
  });
  it('PUTs an existing policy without ownerScope/orgId', async () => {
    fetchWithAuthMock.mockResolvedValue(makeJsonResponse({ id: 'ep-1' }));
    await runEscalationPolicySave({ id: 'ep-1', name: 'On-call', steps: [{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: ['ch-1'] }], ownerScope: 'partner' }, { onUnauthorized: ON_UNAUTHORIZED });
    expect(fetchWithAuthMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/alerts/policies/ep-1', expect.objectContaining({ method: 'PUT' }));
    expect(JSON.parse((fetchWithAuthMock.mock.calls[0]![1] as RequestInit).body as string)).toEqual({ name: 'On-call', steps: [{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: ['ch-1'] }] });
  });
  it('DELETE failure toasts an error', async () => {
    fetchWithAuthMock.mockResolvedValue(makeJsonResponse({ error: 'nope' }, false, 500));
    await expect(runEscalationPolicyDelete({ id: 'ep-1', name: 'On-call' }, { onUnauthorized: ON_UNAUTHORIZED })).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(ActionError);
    expect(showToastMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ type: 'error' }));
  });

D23/D25 regressions in the Task 12 drawer tests: malformed/non-array stored steps open without crashing and show “Stored policy was adjusted”; zero/fractional delay or delay 10081, repeat interval 1441, repeat count 11, eleven steps, and 51 occurrences cannot save. Test delays 1 and 10080 and 50 occurrences as valid. Picker tests cover org-only choices, partner/system additions, partner-wide selected-org users, and preserving previously stored user IDs absent from the org picker through a name/channel edit. Never intersect existing `userIds` with picker results. Mark the user-target policy **product owner confirmation pending**. Add `deliveryPage.escalation.storedPolicyAdjusted` in all locales and import the exported coercion helper wherever a policy list renders legacy steps.

- Read/consume: `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts:75-151,212-219,480-518`, `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/helpers.ts:52-113`, `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts:71-84,380-450,1306-1397`, `apps/api/src/db/schema/monitorDefinitions.ts:57-106`, `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts:106-143`. These ranges were opened on the planning checkout; new files have no pre-existing line ranges.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2's `ResolveDeliveryInput`, `ResolvedDelivery`, `resolveDelivery(input, executor?)`, `DbExecutor`, `partnerIdForOrg`, `railOwnershipCondition`; `monitorKindSchema`, `monitorSeveritySchema`; request `AuthContext`, including `canAccessOrg`, `allowedSiteIds`.
- Produces: `deliveryRoutes`; `deliveryPreviewQuerySchema`; `previewDelivery(input, auth): Promise<DeliveryPreview>` exported from `services/delivery/describeDelivery.ts` for the route and AI tool. This validates the requested org/site/monitor before calling the resolver. No system-context elevation.
- Produces: `describeDelivery(input, resolved, executor?): Promise<DeliveryPreview>`; `DeliveryPreview = ResolvedDelivery & { display: string; description: { channels: Array<{ id: string; name: string; enabled: boolean }>; escalationPolicy: { id: string; name: string } | null; owner: 'organization' | 'partner' | null } }`. `description` is additive: clients localize surrounding text without parsing the English `display` or changing the fixed cross-wave resolver contract.
- HTTP: `GET /alerts/delivery/resolve?orgId=<uuid>&severity=<severity>[&kind=<kind>&siteId=<uuid>&monitorId=<uuid>]` → **bare** `DeliveryPreview`, not `{ data }`. `orgId` and `severity` required; invalid query 400; missing authentication 401; missing `alerts:read`/foreign org/disallowed site 403; missing or wrong-owner org/site/monitor 404; unexpected resolver failure 500. A supplied kind describes a draft condition and takes precedence over the saved monitor kind, matching Task 2. No legacy override is accepted from a browser.
- A partner monitor requires a concrete organization to preview its inherited routing. An omitted site means site-scoped rows fail closed; it does not mean “all sites”. The endpoint never queues a test notification.

- D22–D26 parity: preview delegates to the same resolver order (monitor → unretired legacy source when supplied internally → winning row → null) and must not infer a second escalation or recipient policy. Browser requests cannot inject legacy overrides. Extend the shared gate for a legacy explicit escalation conflicting with a row, an empty-channel decision that still schedules escalation, and org-default deletion restoring the partner row (or inbox-only initial delivery with no partner row). Target-user eligibility remains Task 6’s alert-org fire-time check.

**Step 1 (continued): Extend Task 7's real-Postgres suite before implementing the endpoint**

Retain Task 7's `vi`, `sql`, `getNotificationQueue`, and `orgCtx` imports/helpers. Merge the following imports into that file and extend Task 8's existing middleware mock to this single definition (do not duplicate `Hono`, `deliveryRailsRoutes`, or the mock). Add the request/preview helpers below. Only HTTP authentication/permission injection is mocked; the resolver, ownership queries, route validation, description lookup, and `breeze_app` RLS all remain real. Authentication denials are covered by the route unit suite above. Queue transport is spied, so this gate never sends anything externally.

```ts

Run this extension before creating `delivery.ts` to see `Failed to load url ../../routes/alerts/delivery`; with the file mounted incorrectly the HTTP leg fails `expected 404 to be 200`. A destination mismatch fails the array comparison even when `queued` counts agree. Keep the Task 7 cases: they cover `monitorKinds` and the non-null policy on a `none` monitor as well.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL** (all commands in this task start at the repository root; subshells keep the next command there)

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/alerts/delivery.test.ts src/services/delivery/describeDelivery.test.ts)
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts)

### Task 14: Notify card shows resolved inheritance; Delivery offers the same read-only preview

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/monitoring/MonitorEditor.tsx:179-221,255-265,291-301,344-352,776-815,871-888`; extend `MonitorEditor.test.tsx:1-120,480-510`'s fetch harness and append tests
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.tsx`, `DeliveryPreview.test.tsx`, `DeliveryRuleSetPreview.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.tsx` (Task 11 composition; add preview after Routing)
- Modify: all eight `apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/monitoring.json` (`editor.deliveryPreview`)
- Consume: `apps/web/src/lib/useHashState.ts:1-84`, `apps/web/src/locales/README.md:15-54`, `apps/web/src/locales/en/monitoring.json:80-84,191-197` (existing delivery and severity labels). Opened locale directory contains exactly the eight locales listed above.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 8's `/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=channels|escalation&orgId=<uuid>` and safe inherited channel metadata; Task 10's `useDeliveryResource`; Task 13's bare `DeliveryPreview` JSON; existing `fetchWithAuth`, `asList`, `useHashState`, `monitoring:severities.*`, `monitoring:kinds.*`, `monitoring:editor.deliveryModes.*`.
- Produces: `DeliveryPreview({ orgId, severity, kind?, siteId?, monitorId?, escalationOverride? })`. New monitors and an editor currently choosing **Inherit** request the routing baseline **without `monitorId`**: otherwise a saved `channels`/`none` mode would incorrectly override an unsaved switch to Inherit. An explicit draft escalation selection is displayed independently of the routing baseline, using the already loaded policy name. The resolver still computes all inherited choices. No client reimplementation of routing precedence.
- Produces: `DeliveryRuleSetPreview({ orgId })` on Delivery, with severity/kind/site inputs and a shared preview. No channel-send mutation. Selection is stored in `location.hash` (`#preview/<severity>/<kind-or-all>/<site-or-all>`). Monitor settings/activity hashes stay unchanged. API query strings carry request facts; they never store browser UI state.
- Mode `none` retains the existing localized Inbox-only choice and hides the escalation-policy selector. Mode `channels` retains the existing channel picker, but loads its choices from the delivery rails endpoint, merging channel `data` with safe `inherited` metadata. Load escalation choices from the same endpoint with `rail=escalation`, then apply the DTO-aware `compatibleEscalationPolicies` filter below; neither picker reads `/alerts/channels` or `/alerts/policies`. Move the existing policy selector from the recurrence card into Notify, below these choices, for modes other than `none`; preserve its field name, test ID, and owner-compatible choices. Empty escalation selection means inherit, consistent with independent escalation resolution.
- Preview states: selected org required, loading, response, failure with Retry. A changed org/kind/severity/site immediately hides stale data. Never label a failed request “Inbox only”. Without a site the card explicitly explains that site-specific rows are excluded. Existing monitor saves stay on `runAction`; these new requests are GET only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`DeliveryPreview.test.tsx`:

```tsx
import '@/lib/i18n';
import { act, fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
vi.mock('../../../stores/auth', () => ({ fetchWithAuth: vi.fn() }));

const fetchMock = vi.mocked(fetchWithAuth);
const json = (body: unknown, status = 200) => ({ ok: status === 200, status, json: async () => body }) as Response;

    expect(window.location.search).toBe('');
  });
});
```

In `MonitorEditor.test.tsx`, replace the old channel/policy interceptors in `defaultFetchImpl` and the existing policy/channel tests with `/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=channels` and `/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=escalation` prefix checks (the query includes `orgId`). The default harness returns `{ data: [], inherited: [] }` for channels and `{ data: [] }` for escalation; existing tests keep their channel/policy fixtures under the new endpoint interceptors. In the saved-owner test, await the populated policy options with `waitFor` instead of relying on the monitor request finishing last. Retain the incompatible-owner regression. Add the following preview branch before the fallback, then append inside the existing `describe` (its `beforeEach` remains):

```ts
if (input.startsWith('/alerts/delivery/resolve')) return json({ skippedChannelIds: [], channelIds: [],
  escalationPolicyId: null, source: 'none', description: { channels: [], escalationPolicy: null, owner: null } });
```

```tsx
  it('previews unsaved Inherit instead of the saved channels mode, and keeps delivery configuration at its home', async () => {
    fetchMock.mockImplementation(async input => {
      if (input === '/monitor-definitions/m1') return json({ data: { ...MONITOR_M1_FIXTURE, deliveryMode: 'channels', deliveryChannelIds: ['ch'] } });
      if (input.startsWith('/alerts/delivery/resolve')) return json({ skippedChannelIds: [], channelIds: ['ch'], escalationPolicyId: null,
        source: 'default_row', routingRuleName: 'Everything else', description: {
          channels: [{ id: 'ch', name: 'NOC', enabled: true }], escalationPolicy: null, owner: 'partner' } });
      return defaultFetchImpl(input);
    });
    render(<MonitorEditor monitorId="m1" />);
    await screen.findByDisplayValue('Disk full');
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('monitor-editor-delivery-inherit'));
    expect(await screen.findByTestId('delivery-preview-result')).toHaveTextContent('NOC');
    const calls = fetchMock.mock.calls.filter(([url]) => url.startsWith('/alerts/delivery/resolve'));
    expect(calls.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(calls.every(([url]) => !url.includes('monitorId='))).toBe(true);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('monitor-editor-delivery-home')).toHaveAttribute('href', '/alerts/delivery');
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('monitor-editor-delivery-none'));
    expect(screen.queryByTestId('delivery-preview-result')).toBeNull();
    expect(screen.queryByTestId('monitor-editor-escalation-policy')).toBeNull();
  });
```

Add this top-level mock to `MonitorEditor.test.tsx` (the existing auth mock provides only `fetchWithAuth`):

```tsx
vi.mock('../../lib/authScope', () => ({
  useJwtClaims: () => ({ status: 'resolved', claims: { scope: 'partner', orgId: null, partnerId: 'partner-1' } }),
}));
```

Append these editor regressions using the existing `json`, `defaultFetchImpl`, and `MONITOR_M1_FIXTURE` helpers. Only the rails response supplies the inherited choices; legacy administrative endpoints must never be called.

```tsx
it.each(['create', 'edit'] as const)('%s selects inherited channels and escalation and saves their IDs', async mode => {

Add `act` to this test file's existing Testing Library import. Keep the Task 10 hook’s stale-org and failure/retry tests as prerequisites; neither a pending read nor a failed read clears form IDs.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.test.tsx src/components/monitoring/MonitorEditor.test.tsx)
```
Expected: missing `./DeliveryPreview` module and `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="delivery-preview-result"]` in the editor regression.

`MonitorEditor.tsx`: replace the old `notificationChannels`/`escalationPolicies` state and both `fetchChannels`/`fetchEscalationPolicies` callbacks with Task 10's independent rails hook. Remove those callbacks from the initialization effect and its dependency list; keep `fetchMonitor` and the other loaders there. Rail URL changes must never trigger `fetchMonitor`/`reset`.

Add this import, watch, and choice loading immediately after `ownerOrgId` and before the existing `compatibleEscalationPolicies` memo:

```tsx
import { useDeliveryResource } from '../alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource';
import type { EscalationPolicy } from '../alerts/delivery/deliveryActions';
import { useJwtClaims } from '../../lib/authScope';
// Remove MonitorEditor’s local EscalationPolicy alias; use the DTO union.
const jwt = useJwtClaims();
const currentPartnerId = jwt.status === 'resolved' ? jwt.claims.partnerId : null;
// Alongside the other watch calls:
const watchDeliveryChannelIds = watch('deliveryChannelIds');

// After ownerOrgId: saved org monitors use their persisted org, new monitors
// use the selected org, and partner monitors use that org's inherited rails.
const deliveryChoiceOrgId = ownerOrgId ?? currentOrgId;
const deliveryChoiceSuffix = deliveryChoiceOrgId ? `&orgId=${encodeURIComponent(deliveryChoiceOrgId)}` : '';
const channelRail = useDeliveryResource<NotificationChannel>(`/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=channels${deliveryChoiceSuffix}`);
const escalationRail = useDeliveryResource<EscalationPolicy>(`/alerts/delivery/rails?rail=escalation${deliveryChoiceSuffix}`);
const notificationChannels = useMemo(() => [...new Map([
  ...channelRail.data.map(({ id, name, type }) => ({ id, name, type })),
  ...channelRail.inherited,
].map(channel => [channel.id, channel] as const)).values()], [channelRail.data, channelRail.inherited]);
const escalationPolicies = escalationRail.data;
```

`NotificationChannel` from `components/automations/ActionsEditor.tsx:15` already is `{ id; name; type }`, so no synthetic config fields are needed. Replace the policy ownership memo as follows; inherited DTOs are already pinned by the rails service to the selected org’s partner. A saved partner monitor must belong to the active partner before those choices can be used. Keep new-monitor owner-change validation and the saved-choice preservation tests.

```tsx
const compatibleEscalationPolicies = useMemo(() => escalationPolicies.filter(policy => {
  if (policy.inherited === true) {
    return !isPartnerOwned || isNew || monitorPartnerId === currentPartnerId;
  }
  if (policy.orgId === null && policy.partnerId !== null) {
    return !isPartnerOwned || isNew || policy.partnerId === monitorPartnerId;
  }
  return !isPartnerOwned && policy.orgId === ownerOrgId;
}), [escalationPolicies, isPartnerOwned, isNew, monitorPartnerId, currentPartnerId, ownerOrgId]);
```
 Do not intersect saved form IDs with a loading or failed result. On the existing channel multi-select add `value={watchDeliveryChannelIds}` and `disabled={channelRail.status !== 'success'}` while retaining `register('deliveryChannelIds')`; the controlled value restores saved selections when options arrive. The policy select below likewise uses the watched value. Use the merged safe choices for the existing action editors as well.

Render independent read states inside Notify before the pickers, using Task 11's existing translated keys (no additional locale files):

```tsx
{[channelRail, escalationRail].map((rail, index) => rail.status === 'error'
  ? <div key={index} role="alert">{t('alerts:deliveryPage.loadFailed')}
      <button type="button" onClick={rail.reload}>{t('common:actions.retry')}</button></div>
  : rail.status === 'loading' ? <p key={index} role="status">{t('alerts:deliveryPage.loading')}</p> : null)}
```

Additional imports/watch and exact JSX insertion at the end of Notify, before its closing `</section>`:

```tsx
import DeliveryPreview from '../alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview';
// Alongside the other watch calls:
const watchSeverity = watch('severity');

// JSX inside Notify:
{watchDeliveryMode === 'inherit' && (
  <DeliveryPreview
    orgId={monitorOrgId ?? currentOrgId}
    severity={watchSeverity}
    kind={watchKind}
    escalationOverride={compatibleEscalationPolicies.find(p => p.id === watchEscalationPolicyId) ?? null}
  />
)}
{watchDeliveryMode !== 'none' && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <label htmlFor="monitor-editor-escalation-policy" className="text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground">
      {t('monitoring:editor.fields.escalationPolicy')}
    </label>
    <select id="monitor-editor-escalation-policy" data-testid="monitor-editor-escalation-policy"
      className="h-9 w-full rounded-md border bg-background px-3 text-sm" {...register('escalationPolicyId')}
      value={watchEscalationPolicyId ?? ''} disabled={escalationRail.status !== 'success'}>
      <option value="">{t('monitoring:editor.deliveryModes.inherit')}</option>
      {compatibleEscalationPolicies.map(policy => <option key={policy.id} value={policy.id}>{policy.name}</option>)}
    </select>
  </div>
)}
<a href="/alerts/delivery" data-testid="monitor-editor-delivery-home" className="text-sm text-primary underline">
  {t('monitoring:editor.deliveryPreview.manage')}
</a>
```

Delete the old policy selector block at `MonitorEditor.tsx:871-888` when moving it; leave recurrence threshold/window/actions and their `runAction` submission unchanged. `DeliveryPage.tsx` imports and renders the rule-set preview after `RoutingSection`:

```tsx
import DeliveryRuleSetPreview from './delivery/DeliveryRuleSetPreview';
// Immediately after <RoutingSection ... />:
<DeliveryRuleSetPreview orgId={currentOrgId} />
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add real translations in every locale**

Render the `draft` key immediately above the editor preview (not on the Delivery test panel):

```tsx

### Task 15: Register `manage_delivery` across chat, MCP, guardrails, and the agent catalog

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/railContracts.ts` (shared schemas/access helpers; no route imports)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `routing.ts` (import/re-export moved declarations)
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsDelivery.ts`, `aiToolsDelivery.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiTools.ts:68,318`, `aiToolSchemas.ts:100,1580`, `aiGuardrails.ts:142,1263,1613`, `aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.ts:84`, `aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts:108`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.ts:163,279,2507` (mandatory SDK registration surface)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.ts:24-48,97-117` (export schemas and `getRoutingRuleWithAccess`; site helper exports already ship in Task 8/PR 1)
- Extend: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts:12-28,88`, `aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts:48-54`
- Verify unchanged: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/__snapshots__/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts.snap:50`; run `aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts:16-38` without updating snapshots
- Consume: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:51-76`, `middleware/auth.ts:915-918`, `services/aiGuardrails.ts:1808-1815`, `routes/alerts/helpers.ts:435-447` (verified constraints on MFA, agent principals, tiers, and legacy binding validation).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `registerDeliveryTools(registry: Map<string, AiTool>): void`; tool name exactly **`manage_delivery`**; `deliveryToolShape`, `deliveryToolSchema` in `aiToolSchemas.ts`.
- Resolve output is exactly `DeliveryPreview`: eligible `channelIds`, `skippedChannelIds: Array<{ id: string; reason: 'disabled' | 'unavailable' }>`, escalation, provenance and safe description. Unavailable never distinguishes a foreign ID from a nonexistent ID; no channel configuration or escalation step targets are returned. Inherited list results must use Task 8’s service DTO projections too.
- Actions: `resolve | list_routing | create_routing | update_routing | delete_routing | set_default | list_escalation | create_escalation | update_escalation | delete_escalation`. Top-level ownership (`orgId`, `ownerScope`) is create/list/default-only; `id` chooses update/delete targets and their immutable owner; `data` contains rule/policy fields. Resolve requires `orgId` and `severity`, with optional `kind`, `siteId`, `monitorId`.
- Consumes: Task 13's **`previewDelivery` from `./delivery/describeDelivery`**, Task 3's `upsertDefaultRow`, `assertDefaultRowPatch`, `escalationPolicyCompatible`, `DeliveryWriteError`; Task 5's policy schemas; Task 8's `routingSiteIds` and `canAccessRoutingSites` exports. No alternate delivery resolver and no HTTP bridge: HTTP `requireScope` refuses `ai_agent` principals.
- Read actions: tier 1, `alerts:read`; writes: tier 2, `alerts:write`, existing mutation guardrails and audit path. Tier 2 does **not** mean approval-required in this repository (`aiGuardrails.ts:1808-1815`); do not falsely promise a confirmation dialog. Human writes additionally require MFA; authenticated agent writes use the existing agent guardrails instead. All writes reject site/device ceilings and enforce partner-wide capability.
- `manage_notification_channels` retains channel CRUD/test. Routing, defaults, escalation CRUD, and resolution have one AI home: `manage_delivery`. Do not copy those actions into the channel tool. The old tool's frozen missing-tier entry and unreachable snapshot entry remain unchanged; `manage_delivery` must be present on every surface from its first commit.
- Default deletion is already rejected on both axes by Task 3 and absent from Task 11's UI; keep the AI refusal identical.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing handler and registry tests**

Append to `aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts`; add imports of `checkGuardrails`, `requiredPermissionsForTool` from `./aiGuardrails` and `validateToolInput` from `./aiToolSchemas`:

    expect(getAllRegisteredToolNames()).toContain('manage_delivery');
    expect(TOOL_TIERS.manage_delivery).toBe(1);

  });

  });

    expect(requiredPermissionsForTool('manage_delivery', { action: 'unknown' })).toBeNull();
    expect(validateToolInput('manage_delivery', { action: 'unknown' }).success).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

Append to `aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts` (all imports already present):

```ts
it('makes delivery reachable without changing prior frozen gaps', () => {
  expect(TOOL_CAPABILITY.manage_delivery).toBe('alerts_monitoring');
  expect(listAgentReachableTools()).toContain('manage_delivery');
  expect(listUnreachableRegisteredTools()).not.toContain('manage_delivery');
  expect(listUnreachableRegisteredTools()).toContain('manage_notification_channels');
});
```

Additional tool regressions use the same real validation service as HTTP: org callers cannot newly add a partner-only user, an existing partner-picked ID survives org edits, partner/system callers can select eligible partner users, and partner-wide policies accept active selected-org users while fire-time delivery filters per alert org (**product owner confirmation pending**). Reject out-of-bounds repeat interval/count, eleven steps and 51 occurrences on both create/update; accept 50. Delete an org default with governance access and verify inherited delivery on resolve; deny a ceiling-limited caller and always reject partner-default deletion. `resolve` delegates to Task 13’s preview service, including no-channel escalation and the same D22 precedence.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiToolsDelivery.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts)
```
Expected: missing `./aiToolsDelivery`, then `expected ... to include 'manage_delivery'` until registration is complete.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement schema, handler, and default-row protection**

In `aiToolSchemas.ts`, above `toolInputSchemas` (reuse its existing `z`, `uuid`, `monitorKindSchema` imports/constants):

```ts
export const deliveryToolShape = {
  action: z.enum(['resolve','list_routing','create_routing','update_routing','delete_routing','set_default','list_escalation','create_escalation','update_escalation','delete_escalation']),
  orgId: uuid.optional(), ownerScope: z.enum(['organization', 'partner']).optional(), id: uuid.optional(),
  severity: z.enum(['critical','high','medium','low','info']).optional(), kind: monitorKindSchema.optional(),
  siteId: uuid.optional(), monitorId: uuid.optional(), data: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
};
export const deliveryToolSchema = z.object(deliveryToolShape).strict().superRefine((v, ctx) => {
  if (v.action === 'resolve' && (!v.severity || !v.orgId)) ctx.addIssue({ code: 'custom', message: 'orgId and severity are required for resolve' });
  if (/^(update|delete)_/.test(v.action) && !v.id) ctx.addIssue({ code: 'custom', path: ['id'], message: 'id is required for update/delete' });
  if ((/^(create|update)_/.test(v.action) || v.action === 'set_default') && !v.data) ctx.addIssue({ code: 'custom', path: ['data'], message: 'data is required for writes' });
});
// Add inside toolInputSchemas:
// manage_delivery: deliveryToolSchema,
```

D27: move the shared declarations into `services/delivery/railContracts.ts` before wiring the AI handler: `createRoutingRuleSchema`, `updateRoutingRuleSchema`, `upsertDefaultRowSchema`, `getRoutingRuleWithAccess`, `routingSiteIds`, `canAccessRoutingSites` from `routes/alerts/routing.ts`; `createPolicySchema`, `updatePolicySchema` from `routes/alerts/schemas.ts`; and `resolveWriteOrgId`, `getEscalationPolicyWithOrgCheck` from `routes/alerts/helpers.ts`. Preserve their bodies and authorization checks, adjust relative imports, and have the original route files import/re-export them so existing callers remain compatible. `railContracts.ts` imports `escalationStepsSchema` directly from `./escalationSteps`; the Zod-only step schemas/type remain there as established in Task 5. Move any transitive route-local dependencies with these helpers: this service must have no `routes/` imports. Task 8's route exports still land in PR 1; this PR 3 extraction preserves them. The AI module never invokes Hono middleware.

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire every registry and prompt**

```ts
// aiTools.ts: imports and registration beside registerAlertTools
import { registerDeliveryTools } from './aiToolsDelivery';
registerDeliveryTools(aiTools);

// aiToolSchemas.ts: inside toolInputSchemas
manage_delivery: deliveryToolSchema,

// aiAgentSdkTools.ts: import; inside TOOL_TIERS; inside createBreezeMcpServer's tool array
import { deliveryToolShape } from './aiToolSchemas';
manage_delivery: 1,
tool('manage_delivery', 'Resolve delivery or manage routing rules and escalation policies. Channel CRUD remains manage_notification_channels.',
  deliveryToolShape, makeHandler('manage_delivery', getAuth, onPreToolUse, onPostToolUse)),

// aiGuardrails.ts: inside TIER2_ACTIONS
manage_delivery: ['create_routing','update_routing','delete_routing','set_default','create_escalation','update_escalation','delete_escalation'],
// inside TOOL_PERMISSIONS
manage_delivery: {
  resolve: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'read' },
  list_routing: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'read' },
  list_escalation: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'read' },
  create_routing: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  update_routing: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  delete_routing: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  set_default: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  create_escalation: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  update_escalation: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
  delete_escalation: { resource: 'alerts', action: 'write' },
},
// inside TOOL_RATE_LIMITS
manage_delivery: { limit: 10, windowSeconds: 300 },

// aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.ts: inside TOOL_CAPABILITY
manage_delivery: 'alerts_monitoring',
```

Insert this exact bullet in the tool section of `aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts`'s existing prompt string (no new template-string delimiters):

```text
- **Alert delivery**: manage_delivery (resolve/list_routing/create_routing/update_routing/delete_routing/set_default/list_escalation/create_escalation/update_escalation/delete_escalation). Resolve inheritance before changing delivery. An empty channelIds list on set_default means inbox only initially; independently resolved escalation still runs. The partner default is permanent; delete_routing may remove the optional org default with governance access to inherit again. Channel CRUD remains manage_notification_channels.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run, expect PASS**

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiToolsDelivery.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSystemPrompt.test.ts src/routes/alerts/routing.defaultRow.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts src/__tests__/site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery/RoutingSection.test.tsx src/components/alerts/delivery/deliveryActions.test.ts)
git diff --exit-code -- apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/__snapshots__/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts.snap
```

The frozen snapshot must pass without `-u`: this wave adds a reachable tool and does not make the existing channel tool reachable. This explicitly covers the snapshot promised in File Structure; changing it would conceal an unrelated reachability change.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/delivery/railContracts.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/helpers.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsDelivery.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsDelivery.test.ts apps/api/src/services/aiTools.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemas.ts apps/api/src/services/aiGuardrails.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.registryParity.contract.test.ts apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts/routing.ts

### Task 16: Document the Delivery home, visible defaults, preview, and upgrade behavior

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/notifications.mdx:8,352-403,611-614`
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/alerts.mdx:2-10,188-236`
- Read/verify: `apps/docs/package.json:7-11` (`check`, `build`), `apps/web/src/locales/README.md:32-42` (required PR locale disclosure lines)
- No docs redirects are removed in this task; W05c2/W05d own the alert-template/service-monitoring retirements and migration guides.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `/alerts/delivery`, web-only 301s from `/alerts/channels` and `/alerts/routing-rules`; HTTP channel APIs remain `/alerts/channels*`. `GET /alerts/delivery/resolve` returns a bare decision plus `display`; `manage_delivery` is the routing/escalation/preview AI home.
- Produces: domain navigation **Inbox · Monitors · Delivery**, honest transitional legacy-override wording, explicit default ownership/precedence, opt-in new-channel release note, instructions for the Notify preview and Delivery rule-set preview. No promise that W05d's retirements already shipped.
- Release-note text is checked into the Notifications page's upgrade callout and copied verbatim into PR 3's release notes; do not guess the release version before the orchestrator assigns it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the documentation regression assertion**

This is an inline test, not a new production/test file. Run exactly this Python program from the repository root before and after the edit:

alerts = (root / 'alerts.mdx').read_text()
for document in (notifications, alerts):
    assert '**Alerts > Delivery**' in document, 'missing Delivery navigation'
    assert 'Everything else' in document, 'missing explicit default'
    assert 'all enabled org channels' not in document, 'stale all-channel fallback'

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL**

Run Step 1's command. Expected first failure on the current checkout: `AssertionError: missing Delivery navigation`. It must not be bypassed by weakening the assertion or suppressing its exit code.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the documentation replacements**

Replace the opening paragraph at `notifications.mdx:8` with:

```mdx
Breeze delivers alert notifications through the channels configured in **Alerts > Delivery**. The page has three sections: Channels, Routing, and Escalation policies. Channels and routing can belong to one organization or to its partner. Every alert still creates in-app notifications; external delivery follows the monitor's Notify choice and the visible routing rows, ending at **Everything else**.
```

Replace the entire section from `## Notification Routing` through the separator immediately before `## API Reference` with this content (leave all sender configuration and API channel examples intact):

````mdx
## Notification Routing

Open **Alerts > Delivery**, then **Routing**. A monitor's own Notify setting wins; otherwise the first matching row from the top decides delivery.

<Steps>
1. In-app notifications are created independently of external delivery.
2. A monitor set to **Inbox only** sends no external notifications and does not escalate. A monitor set to **Use these channels instead** uses its own channel list.
3. During the conversion period, an unretired legacy rule's explicit channel override still applies. Conversion carries that choice onto the monitor; upgrading Delivery does not silently remove it.
4. Other alerts use the first matching enabled routing row. Rows match severity, monitor kind (`monitorKinds`), and site. Lower priority numbers run first; organization rows win ties with partner rows. Non-default rows are considered before defaults.
5. If no ordinary row matches, the organization's **Everything else** row applies when present; otherwise the partner's **Everything else** row applies. Empty default channels mean **Inbox only** initially. With no default row, initial delivery is also inbox only; any independently resolved escalation still runs.
</Steps>

A site-specific row matches only a known matching site. A monitor-kind row cannot match an alert with no monitor kind. The old condition-type and device-tag routing inputs never affected delivery and are no longer accepted.

**Everything else** is always shown last and cannot be reordered. The partner row is permanent; **Use partner default** removes an optional org override after confirming the inherited channels/escalation (or inbox only). Its channels and escalation policy can be edited. In an organization view, **Customize for this organization** creates the optional org default from the partner's current choices. That row stops following the partner default for that organization and can be removed later to inherit again.

### Preview delivery

A monitor's **Notify > Inherit** card shows the channel names, the matching row and its owner, and the escalation policy. Its link opens **Alerts > Delivery**. Changing severity or monitor kind refreshes the preview using the current editor values. Explicit channel and inbox-only choices remain editable on the monitor.

On Delivery, **Test this rule set** previews a severity, optional monitor kind, and optional site. Select an organization first for partner-wide monitors. Without a site, site-specific rows are excluded. This preview does not send notifications.

The API is `GET /alerts/delivery/resolve?orgId=<uuid>&severity=critical&kind=cpu&siteId=<uuid>&monitorId=<uuid>`. Only `orgId` and `severity` are required. It returns eligible `channelIds`, `skippedChannelIds`, `escalationPolicyId`, `source`, optional `routingRuleId`/`routingRuleName`, a readable `display`, and structured names in `description`. A supplied monitor ID uses that saved monitor's Notify settings. The request is read-only and requires `alerts:read`; an inaccessible org/site/monitor is rejected.

The decision returns eligible `channelIds` and `skippedChannelIds` with `disabled` or `unavailable` reasons. Unavailable channels may be missing, outside the organization’s ownership, or invisible to the current session; the preview does not distinguish those cases. The preview shows both, and escalation resolves independently. Channel test results, send failures, throttles, suppression, and acknowledgement can affect actual delivery after a decision is made; a preview is not a delivery receipt.

### Escalation policies

Open **Alerts > Delivery > Escalation policies** to create, edit, or delete a policy. Give it a name and timed steps, then choose it on a routing row or in a monitor's Notify card. Partner-wide policies have an **All orgs** badge and require partner-wide management access to change.

Steps notify channels, users in-app, or both, with at least one target per step. Use 1..10 steps, integer delays of 1..10080 minutes, repeat intervals of 1..1440 minutes and 1..10 additional sends, with at most 50 total occurrences. Optional `renotify: { everyMinutes, maxTimes }` repeats a step at that interval; `maxTimes` is the number of additional sends after its first notification.

Escalation resolves independently of the initial channel list: an explicit monitor escalation wins unless Notify is **Inbox only**; otherwise an unretired legacy source's explicit escalation wins, followed by the winning routing/default row's escalation, then none. W05d removes the legacy arm only after conversion or retirement, leaving monitor → row → null. An empty default channel list can therefore mean inbox now and escalation later. Acknowledging or resolving the alert cancels pending escalation jobs.

```json
{
  "name": "On-call",
  "steps": [
    { "delayMinutes": 15, "channelIds": ["channel-uuid-1"] },
    { "delayMinutes": 60, "channelIds": ["channel-uuid-1"], "userIds": ["user-uuid-1"], "renotify": { "everyMinutes": 15, "maxTimes": 2 } }
  ]
}
```

User targets are validated on save and checked again against the alert’s organization when delivered: active unrestricted org members or partner users whose all/selected org access includes that org. Org callers may newly select only org members, while existing partner-picked targets survive edits. Partner/system callers can also select partner users; partner-wide policies list all active partner users and re-filter per alert. **Product owner confirmation pending** (HO-20260919-alerting-consolidation Q1).

### From automations

An automation's `send_notification` action targets its configured channel explicitly. It does not change the alert delivery defaults.

### AI and MCP

Use `manage_delivery` to resolve delivery, list/create/update/delete ordinary routing rows, edit the default with `set_default`, remove an optional org default with `delete_routing` to inherit again (the partner default is permanent), and list/create/update/delete escalation policies using the same bounded schemas and caller-aware user validation as the web/API. Reads require `alerts:read`; mutations require `alerts:write` and the applicable ownership and MFA/agent guards. Use `manage_notification_channels` for channel CRUD and test sends.

### Upgrade note: explicit defaults

<Aside type="caution" title="New channels are opt-in">
New notification channels are not subscribed to anything until added to a routing row.

The upgrade creates **Everything else** rows from the previously effective enabled-channel set. A partner row contains its enabled partner-wide channels. An org row is created only when that org has enabled org-owned channels, and contains those channels plus the partner's enabled partner-wide channels. Existing ordinary routing rows and explicit overrides retain precedence. Review the resulting rows in Delivery before adding new destinations.
</Aside>

## Partner-wide Channels and Routing

Choose **All organizations** when creating a partner-owned channel, routing row, or escalation policy. Ownership is fixed at creation. The org view shows its rows together with inherited partner rows; inherited rows are labelled and read-only. Manage partner rows from the partner view. Inherited reads never include channel configuration or escalation step targets: channels show identity, type and enabled state, routing shows site-filtered conditions and destination IDs, and escalation policies show identity and step count.

Partner-wide channels do not automatically subscribe new alerts merely because they exist. Add them to a routing/default row or a monitor's explicit channel choice. Test sends on a shared channel require partner-wide management access. Delivery history, throttling, and send records remain scoped to the firing device's organization.

---

````

Replace the answer beneath `**No notifications being sent for alerts.**` at `notifications.mdx:614` with:

```mdx
Open the monitor's Notify preview or **Alerts > Delivery > Test this rule set** with the alert's organization, severity, kind, and site. Check which row won, whether it has channels, and whether those channels are enabled and pass a channel test. A new channel receives no alerts until it is explicitly selected. An empty Everything else row or no default row produces only in-app notifications unless an independent escalation is configured. Existing legacy overrides remain effective during conversion. Confirm the notification dispatcher is running and inspect delivery history for failed or throttled sends.
```

In `alerts.mdx`, change frontmatter to `title: Alerts`, `sidebar.label: "Alerts"`, and `description: Manage the alert inbox, author monitors, and configure delivery in Breeze RMM.` Replace its opening paragraph at line 10 with:

```mdx
Alerts is the home for the conditions you monitor, the problems that need attention, and the people who get told.

| Facet | Purpose | Console route |
|---|---|---|
| Inbox | Review and acknowledge active alerts | `/alerts` |
| Monitors | Define a condition, automated response, and Notify choice | `/alerts/monitors` |
| Delivery | Configure channels, routing, defaults, and escalation | `/alerts/delivery` |

Create new conditions as [Monitors](/features/monitors/). Existing legacy rules remain available during the conversion period. The delivery changes below do not retire those rules or change their explicit notification overrides.
```

Replace from `### Setting Up a Channel` through the separator before `## Offline Duration for Configuration Policy Rules` with:

```mdx
### Setting Up a Channel

<Steps>
1. Go to **Alerts > Delivery**, then **Channels**, and click **New channel**.
2. Enter a name, choose a type, and fill in its connection settings.
3. Choose **This organization only** or, with partner-wide management access, **All organizations**. Ownership cannot change later.
4. Save, then use **Test** to verify the destination.
5. Add the channel to a routing row, **Everything else**, or a monitor's explicit Notify choice. Creating a channel alone does not subscribe it to alerts.
</Steps>

## Notification Routing Rules

Open **Alerts > Delivery > Routing**. Add a rule with a name, priority, optional severities, monitor kinds, and sites, plus notification channels and an optional escalation policy. Save in the row drawer.

The monitor's Notify override wins. Otherwise the first matching enabled ordinary row wins: priority ascending, organization before partner at equal priority. If none matches, the optional organization **Everything else** row wins over the partner default. A default with empty channels means inbox only initially; independent escalation still runs; neither default can be reordered. The partner default is permanent; the optional org default can be removed with **Use partner default** to inherit again. During conversion an unretired legacy rule's explicit delivery override also retains precedence.

Use **Test this rule set** to inspect the decision for one organization, severity, kind, and site without sending a notification. The monitor's **Notify > Inherit** card uses the same resolver and shows the inherited destinations and their source.

## Escalation Policies

Create and edit policies in **Alerts > Delivery > Escalation policies**, then select one on a routing row or in the monitor's Notify card. Escalation is independent of initial channels: an explicit monitor escalation wins except in Inbox-only mode, followed by an unretired legacy source’s explicit escalation, then the winning routing row’s escalation, then none. Acknowledging or resolving an alert cancels pending escalation jobs.

See [Notifications](/features/notifications/#notification-routing) for the complete precedence, API preview, and upgrade note. Existing bookmarks to the Channels and Routing Rules console pages redirect permanently to Delivery; the channel API URLs remain unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS; include exact release text in PR 3**

Run Step 1's Python assertion again; expected `delivery docs contract: PASS`. Then:

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs check
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs build
```

PR 3 release-note text:

```text
Alerts now has a Delivery page for channels, routing, and escalation policies. The monitor Notify card and the Delivery rule-set preview show the same decision the dispatcher uses.

New notification channels are not subscribed to anything until added to a routing row. Existing enabled destinations are preserved in visible Everything else rows created during upgrade. Unretired legacy rules keep their explicit delivery overrides during conversion.

Settings home: /alerts/delivery. Levels: partner default → organization override. Resolver: resolveDelivery. Configuration places before: 2; after: 2 (Delivery plus a monitor's explicit Notify override).

### Task 17: Verify each PR and the complete W05b delivery contract

**Files:**
- Verify: every production/test path in Tasks 1–16, including the migration and existing tenant export/RLS/cascade registrations
- Verify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/deliveryDefaultRowsMigration.integration.test.ts`, `deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts`, `notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts`, `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`, `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts`, `tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts`, `tenantCascade.integration.test.ts`
- Verify: `apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts`, `autoMigrate.test.ts`, `migrationOrdering.test.ts`; `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts`, `lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts`
- Modify only if the checks identify a defect in this wave: its owning implementation and regression test, using the Task 1–16 file lists. Verification itself adds no production feature, migration, or empty commit.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: PR 1 Tasks 1–8; PR 2 Tasks 9–12 on PR 1; PR 3 Tasks 13–16 on PRs 1–2. Run the full API unit suite and relevant remaining blocks **before each PR**; absent future-PR files are not failure waivers for the final wave gate.
- Produces: passing typecheck/build; unit, i18n, guardrail, migration replay, and real `breeze_app` integration evidence; no all-enabled-channel fallback or old console destinations; stable cross-wave names. The spec gate requires exact channel IDs and independent escalation agreement, not just equal counts or a mocked database. D21 additionally requires identical unavailable results and HTTP shapes for foreign/missing references, exact inherited DTO keys (no config or step targets), and denial of partner writes from org tokens (42501/403). No new policy or RLS allowlist edit is permitted; the replay suite covers only migration row/column/index behavior.
- Migration ordering: before pushing, inspect the newest migration on **origin/main** and compare with `2026-10-23-100000-delivery-routing-default-rows.sql`; rename only an unshipped migration if needed and update every filename reference in this plan's implemented tests. Never rename a shipped migration.
- Commands below are **implementation-time instructions**. The plan-finishing author must not execute them while appending this document. All commands start from the repository root; parentheses prevent accumulated `cd` state. Any failure stops the pass; no `grep`-filtered typecheck, `|| echo` success mask, or snapshots updated to hide mismatches.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write/run the acceptance assertions before calling the wave complete**

This root-level inline check is the failing test for missing wiring. It reads files only; it does not import application modules or need Docker.

PY
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Expect FAIL on incomplete work, then resolve the specific failing gate**

Before PR 3 exists, Step 1 reports `AssertionError: missing W05b artifact: apps/api/src/services/delivery/describeDelivery.ts`. After Task 13, a missing SDK registration reports `missing AI registration: aiAgentSdkTools.ts`. Run the checks for the PR that exists; run the entire assertion after Tasks 13–16. A missing future artifact is expected on PR 1/2, not a reason to claim full-wave success.

The mandatory PR-1 independent-escalation regression covers the old `notificationDispatcher.ts:398-400` early return; Tasks 2/4 eliminate that second filter. Add this case to `notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts` using Task 4's queue harness:

```ts
it('inherit escalation survives filtering all disabled baseline channels', async () => {
  channelEligibilityMock.mockResolvedValueOnce([{ id: 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000014', orgId: 'org-1', partnerId: null, enabled: false }]);
  selectQueue.push(
    [makeAlert({ ruleId: null, configPolicyId: null, monitorId: 'monitor-1' })],
    [{ id: 'device-1', displayName: 'Server-1' }], ORG_LOOKUP, ORG_LOOKUP,
    [{ kind: 'cpu', deliveryMode: 'inherit', deliveryChannelIds: [], escalationPolicyId: 'ep1' }],
    [DEFAULT_ROW],
    [{ id: 'ep1', orgId: 'org-1', partnerId: null, steps: [{ delayMinutes: 5, channelIds: ['aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000011'] }] }],
    [{ id: 'aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000011' }],
  );
  const result = await processAlertNotifications({ type: 'process-alert', alertId: 'alert-1' });
  expect(result.queued).toBe(0);
  expect(queueAddBulkMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(queueAddMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run)
```

Expected before the correction: `expected "spy" to be called 1 times, but got 0 times`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify independent escalation and run unfiltered builds/checks**

Task 2 performs all channel eligibility filtering and Task 4 schedules escalation even for an empty eligible set. If the regression fails, repair those tasks before PR 1; do not reintroduce a second dispatcher filter. This is a mandatory gate before every PR.

Build/typecheck (API on all PRs; web on PRs 2/3; docs on PR 3):

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/api build
(cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit -p .)
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs check
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs build
```

Unit checks for PR 1 and each dependent PR:

```bash
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run)
```

Additional PR 2/3 web checks:

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/DeliveryPage.test.tsx src/components/alerts/delivery/useDeliveryResource.test.tsx src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx src/components/alerts/delivery/deliveryActions.test.ts src/components/alerts/delivery/RoutingSection.test.tsx src/components/alerts/delivery/EscalationPoliciesSection.test.tsx src/lib/i18n/translationCoverage.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/settingsPageRegistry.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-translated-comparisons.test.ts)
```

Additional PR 3 web checks (API coverage is included in the full suite above):

```bash
(cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.test.tsx src/components/monitoring/MonitorEditor.test.tsx)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run real-database contracts, inspect migration ordering, and expect PASS**

Run once per verification session against the repository's isolated test stack (never against production):

```bash
pnpm test-stack up
(cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/deliveryDefaultRowsMigration.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/deliveryResolution.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/notificationRailsPartnerRls.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts)
pnpm db:check-drift
pnpm test-stack down
```

Expected: default-row replay has enabled-only partner and org channel-set equality, both partial unique indexes, and idempotency, with no eligibility routine calls or definition introspection; dispatcher/preview gate executes every applicable case on PR 1 and PR 3, zero skipped; foreign/missing references have the same unavailable reason and HTTP shape, inherited DTOs have exactly the permitted keys and no config, and org partner-rail writes fail with 42501/403; both new scalar columns are classified; schema drift is empty. A missing `DATABASE_URL` that skips every `runDb` test is a failed verification, not a pass. If a command fails, stop the test stack with `pnpm test-stack down` after retaining its error output.

Check only top-level runnable SQL migrations on origin/main (exclude optional/preflight subdirectories):

```bash
git fetch origin && git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations | grep -E '^apps/api/migrations/[0-9]{4}-[^/]+\.sql$' | sort | tail -1
scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
```

Compare filenames; rename only an unshipped migration and update the replay filename if a newer migration has landed. Never rename shipped migrations.

Finish with these read-only assertions and review the output:

```bash
git diff --check
rg -n 'resolveDelivery|previewDelivery|manage_delivery' apps/api/src/services/delivery apps/api/src/routes/alerts/delivery.ts apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsDelivery.ts
rg -n 'deliveryPreview' apps/web/src/locales/*/monitoring.json
rg -n 'Everything else|New notification channels|GET /alerts/delivery/resolve' apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/notifications.mdx
```

Repeat Task 16's docs assertion and Task 17 Step 1's wiring assertion. Confirm all eight locales have the new keys. Inspect the UI using the existing development environment: inherited partner row in an org, org default shadowing, empty default, independent monitor escalation, preview failure/retry, unsaved mode switch, and hash back/forward. Do not call a channel's **Test** button as part of a read-only preview inspection. These are supplementary visual checks; the automated endpoint/queue/RLS assertions remain the release gate.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit only verification fixes and record the result before each PR**

Stage only defects found by verification; the independent-escalation correction is mandatory in PR 1. Do not create an empty “verification passed” commit:

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.monitorDelivery.test.ts
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
  git commit -m "fix(alerts): preserve independent escalation after channel filtering (W05b)"
fi
git status --short
```

The implementation handoff records each command's pass/fail status, integration cases executed (and zero skips), migration ordering result, and any baseline failures separately. PRs 1/2 reference the wave with a scope note; PR 3 closes the registered wave issue only when all its promised work and gates pass. Use the assigned issue number, not an invented number. Do not merge as part of this plan.

**Open questions:** None. D21 supersedes D1’s eligibility boundary and skip vocabulary; D16 and D18 settle the other delivery choices raised by the review.
