# Alerting Consolidation — W05d Retirement Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Retire every legacy alert-authoring path for good: a boot-time system-scope sweep converts (or retires with a reason) whatever W05c left unconverted, the per-policy check interval moves to the `monitors` link, and the policy Alerts / Service & Process tabs, `/alerts/rules`, the legacy write routers, the second evaluation sweep, the transitional delivery override and the one-shot migrate script are deleted — with a startup count check that is loud, never silent, when something is still unretired.

**Architecture:** The sweep is TypeScript, not SQL — W05c1's converter creates monitor definitions, compiles them, moves open alerts and runs an equivalence check over devices, none of which SQL can express — so it mirrors the built-in-monitors backfill (`apps/api/src/index.ts:1855-1871`): detached after `serve()`, one `runOutsideDbContext + withSystemDbAccessContext` transaction per partner, outcome recorded on `partners.settings`, opt-out by env var. The migration file does only the SQL-expressible half: re-keying `config_policy_monitoring_settings` from each policy's `monitoring` link to its `monitors` link (creating that link when absent) and reporting unretired counts. The startup count check is chained *after* the sweep in the same detached promise, so the first boot after upgrade cannot fire it spuriously; it logs at error level, reports to Sentry and feeds the pending endpoint the banner already reads. Retired `alert_rule`/`monitoring` feature-link rows stay in the database (the Postgres enum keeps the values); the API filters `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` out of every listing and resolver so no reader ever sees a feature type outside `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES`.

**Tech Stack:** Hono, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL 16, zod (`packages/shared`), Vitest (unit with Drizzle mocks; integration against real Postgres via `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/setup`), React + react-i18next (8 locales), Astro (web pages + Starlight docs), Sentry (`services/sentry.ts`).

**Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-19-alerting-consolidation-design.md (§Removed screens and routes — rows marked W05d; §Data model "Monitors" last bullet and "Config feature types (W05d)"; §Delivery resolution "Transitional (W05b → W05d)"; §Conversion "Other writers" rows marked W05d and "Who runs it" self-hosted bullet; §Evaluation W05d bullet; §AI / MCP tools rows marked W05d; §Docs and release notes; §Waves W05d row)

## Ordering assumptions (read first)

- **W05a, W05b, W05c1 and W05c2 have shipped in a prior release.** W05d must not ship in the same release as W05c: the hosted "Convert everything" pass and the self-hosted banner need one full release cycle before anything is deleted (spec §Waves: "W05d depends on W05c having shipped in a prior release"). Both W05d PRs ship in the *same* release, PR2 after PR1 is merged.
- **W05c1 contracts are prerequisites, not files created by W05d.** `services/monitors/conversion/index.ts` re-exports `previewPolicyConversion`, `previewPartnerConversion(partnerId, auth)`, `convertPartnerLegacy(partnerId, previewHash, auth)`, `revertConversion`, and `retireSource(...): Promise<{ conversionId: string }>`; `loadSources.ts` owns `countPendingConversions`. Routes live in `apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.ts`, mounted by `monitorDefinitions.ts`, with `GET /monitor-definitions/conversion/pending?orgId → { data: { policies, rows } }`. W05d consumes the binding D1–D20 contract even if another wave's plan is still being edited. `legacyBaseline.ts` exports `resolveLegacyBaseline(deviceId: string, executor: DbExecutor)` and stays private and executor-aware after public readers are removed. `lifecycle.ts` exports `isRevertAvailable(sourceTable: ConversionSourceTable): boolean`; Task 6 closes Revert for the five retired source tables. The nullable-system-actor writes, full partner preview/hash, template-group ledger, provenance restoration and coverage-preserving workflow rehoming must ship in C1. The retirement columns come from `2026-10-23-120000-legacy-source-retirement-columns.sql`.
- **W05c2 names come from its plan** (`2026-09-19-alerting-consolidation-w05c2-conversion-web-and-tools.md`): the banner is `apps/web/src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionPendingBanner.tsx`, every conversion path is centralised in `components/monitoring/conversion/conversionApi.ts` (`conversionPaths.pending(orgId)`), and W05c2 Task 3 put the *Check interval* field on the Monitors tab (test id `monitors-tab-check-interval`) writing through `useFeatureLink.save(…, { featureType: 'monitoring', … })` — spec §Data model: keyed by the `monitoring` link **until W05d**. Task 2 repoints that write at the `monitors` link and rewrites W05c2's three test cases for it. W05a already deleted the `hub.*` keys in `monitoring.json` and the `pages/monitoring/*.astro` redirect stubs, and `AlertRuleEditPage`/`AlertRuleEditor`; `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertRuleForm.tsx` (+ `AlertRuleForm.retiredCondition.test.tsx`, `index.ts` export) survives W05a with no page importing it and goes in Task 11.
- **Sweep = TypeScript after `serve()`, migration = SQL before it.** `initializeDatabaseForStartup({ autoMigrateEnabled })` (`apps/api/src/index.ts:1679-1682`) runs every migration before the listener; `ensureBuiltInMonitorsForAllPartners()` (`index.ts:1855-1871`, body at `services/monitors/builtInMonitors.ts:226-264`) is the precedent for per-partner work that must not delay `/health`. The W05d sweep is wired exactly the same way, immediately after it. Between `serve()` and the sweep finishing, unconverted inline rules do not fire — that window is the reason the release notes (Task 14) tell self-hosters to run *Convert everything* on the W05c release first.
- **The startup check counts two tables, not one.** The spec names `config_policy_alert_rules WHERE retired_at IS NULL`; after Task 3 the agent config builder no longer delivers `config_policy_monitoring_watches` either, so an unretired watch is exactly as silent as an unretired rule. Both counts must be zero.
- **Network checks retain their runtime and are outside automatic retirement.** Task 4's refusal allowlist and Task 6's Revert guard cover the same five legacy source tables, excluding `network_monitors`. W05e PR1 requires **#6352 and #6353 merged**, with #6353's extended scope evaluating each managed check independently of the alert device's online status, using legacy alert-device selection (linked asset device, preferred site, else most-recently-seen org device; offline devices eligible). It exports `NETWORK_CHECK_DEVICE_INDEPENDENT_EVALUATION = true as const` from `apps/api/src/services/alertConditions/handlers/networkCheck.ts`. That export is absent in this checkout; `apps/api/src/jobs/monitorWorker.ts:294-345` confirms the legacy selection. W05e Task 7 owns D20's capability gate: absent/false means the whole network preview is `blockedBy: 'prerequisite_missing'` with no conversion/refusal candidates; partner preview propagates `ConversionPrerequisiteMissingError`, never synthesizing network retirement reasons. Task 4 records a failed partner sweep without conversion, retirement or a completion marker when that preview throws. With the capability present, representable checks may convert through W05e; its Task 9 proves an offline alert device plus a failing check raises exactly one monitor alert. W05d never auto-retires refused network checks, including on subsequent boots after W05e ships.
- **Equivalence refusals in the sweep become `unconvertible:equivalence_delta`.** The per-policy panel refuses a conversion whose before/after device sets differ and waits for a human (spec §Equivalence check). The sweep has no human, and after Task 9 the legacy evaluator is gone, so an unretired-but-unconverted row would be *silently* dead. The sweep therefore retires such rows with that reason so they are listed in the banner (spec §Conversion "Who runs it": "Nothing stops firing without being listed"). This is binding decision D19: refuse conversion on equivalence delta; retire and list the source. The comparison uses the retained normalized legacy baseline (D6), including resolved delivery, never the removed public feature readers.
- **Open alerts of a retired-unconvertible source stay open for a human.** `checkAutoResolveFromConfigPolicy` (`services/alertService.ts:1386`, called from `jobs/alertWorker.ts:324`) is part of the legacy path and is deleted in Task 9; converted sources already had their non-terminal alerts moved to the compiled rule by W05c1 (spec §Open alerts), so only unconvertible sources are affected. Release notes say so.
- **Code facts the spec/brief did not list, all verified and all in scope here:** `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy` has a *second* caller, `jobs/offlineDetector.ts:505` (`triggerConfigPolicyOfflineAlerts`, lines 476-520); the acknowledge-cooldown branch is duplicated in `routes/mobile.ts:1252-1256` and `services/alertService.ts:746-756` (`resolveAlert`); `getApplicableRulesFromPolicy` is also read by `services/offlineAlertEffects.ts:49` (the #6342 fix adds monitor resolution "alongside" it — the legacy half goes here); `PARTNER_LINKABLE_FEATURE_TYPES` (`services/configurationPolicy.ts:2654`) and `validateFeaturePolicyExists` (`:2804`, `:2826`, `:2890`) still name `alert_rule`/`monitoring`; the shared `addFeatureLinkSchema` hand-lists every feature type (`packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts:568`) instead of deriving from `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES`, as does the AI tool's JSON schema (`services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:908-916`); `manage_alert_rules` `create_rule`/`update_rule`/`delete_rule` are *already* refused (`services/aiToolsFleet.ts:2579-2583`) but every pointer says `manage_policy_feature_link` + `alert_rule`; `routes/agents/helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts` pins the `monitoring`-link query sequence that Task 3 changes.
- **Retired feature-link rows are kept, and filtered.** Deleting `config_policy_feature_links` rows of type `alert_rule`/`monitoring` would cascade-delete `config_policy_alert_rules` (FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `db/schema/configurationPolicies.ts:190`) and strand `alerts.config_policy_id` history, which spec C4 forbids. So the rows stay; `listFeatureLinks` and `resolveEffectiveConfigWithExecutor` exclude `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` (Task 7), and the web never receives them.
- **Two PRs, in order:** PR1 = Tasks 1–6 (migration + re-key + agent builder + sweep + boot check + pending endpoint/banner + lifecycle guard). PR2 = Tasks 7–14 (constants + parity, service-branch deletions, evaluator deletion, transitional delivery removal, 410 routers, web deletions, AI tools + migrate script, docs + release notes). Task 15 is the verification pass run at the end of each PR. PR2 branches from `main` after PR1 merges — a PR based on a sibling branch runs no CI (CLAUDE.md, tenancy section).

## Global Constraints

- **Migration filename `2026-10-24-100000-legacy-alerting-retirement-sweep.sql`** (assigned by the common brief). Before pushing: `git fetch origin && git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations | grep -E '^apps/api/migrations/[0-9]{4}-[^/]+\.sql$' | sort | tail -1` must sort **before** it (newest on main at review: `2026-10-21-110100-…`; W05b/W05c1 use `2026-10-23-*`, W05e uses `2026-10-24-110000-*`). Also run `scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main`. Rename with a later `HHMMSS` if anything newer landed. Never name it for today's real date — shipped names run weeks ahead of the calendar and a today-named file would replay before the W05c1 columns it depends on.
- The migration is idempotent (`NOT EXISTS` guards on every insert/update), has **no inner `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`**, starts with `SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);` because it contains DML (`migrationRlsScope.test.ts` — never join its frozen baseline), and every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` reports its row count with `GET DIAGNOSTICS … RAISE WARNING`. The detection `SELECT`s that report unretired counts run *after* the elevation for the same reason (a `'none'`-scope read sees zero rows through `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`).
- **No new tables, no new columns, no RLS change.** C1's nullable system actors, template-group source provenance and output ownership constraints are prerequisites and retained unchanged. `config_policy_monitoring_settings` keeps its shape; only `feature_link_id` values move. No `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`, `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`, `CORE_DEVICE_*` or `DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES` change. `partners.settings` (jsonb) gains a `legacyAlertingRetirement` key — `partners` carries no `org_id`, so no export-policy entry.
- **Partner-axis writes:** the sweep writes `partners.settings` and, through the converter, `monitor_definitions` rows with `partner_id`. If `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` or `site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts` flags `services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts`, add the allowlist entry with the reason *"boot-time system sweep; per-partner `runOutsideDbContext + withSystemDbAccessContext`, no caller"* — the same reason `builtInMonitors.ts` carries.
- **The agent wire shape is frozen.** `monitoring_settings` on the wire stays exactly `{ check_interval_seconds: int, watches: MonitoringWatchConfig[] }` (`routes/agents/helpers.ts:2019-2036`; Go `agent/internal/monitoring/types.go`). Task 3 changes only where the values come from. `auto_restart` semantics are unchanged.
- Deleted code is deleted, not commented out or feature-flagged. Every deleted export gets its tests deleted or rewritten in the same task; `pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit` is the sweep for missed importers.
- Web mutations go through `runAction` (`apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`); catch pattern per CLAUDE.md. Tab state is hash-based (`useHashTab`); the legacy hashes are rewritten with `history.replaceState`, never with a query param.
- Every new i18n key needs **real translations in all 8 locales** (`apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}`); the coverage test fails on a missing or English-echoed key. Removed components take their key blocks out of all 8 files.
- Every task: **red test first**, then `pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit` (and `pnpm --filter @breeze/web exec tsc --noEmit` for web tasks), then the task's targeted tests, then commit. Use `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`; never `pnpm --filter … test -- --run <path>`; never a trailing-slash path filter.
- `pnpm test` does **not** run the integration suites. Tasks 1–6 and 15 need `pnpm test-stack up` (private pg+redis for this worktree) and `pnpm test-stack down` afterwards — nothing reaps it for you.
- Do not commit from a subagent; the orchestrator commits. Each task's Step 5 gives the commit message.

### Task 1: Migration — re-key `config_policy_monitoring_settings` to the `monitors` link and report leftovers (PR1)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-24-100000-legacy-alerting-retirement-sweep.sql`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementMigration.integration.test.ts`
- Test (existing, auto-discover): `apps/api/src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts`, `apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `config_policy_feature_links(config_policy_id, feature_type, feature_policy_id, inline_settings)` with `config_feature_links_unique (config_policy_id, feature_type)` (`db/schema/configurationPolicies.ts:118-133`); `config_policy_monitoring_settings(feature_link_id UNIQUE, check_interval_seconds)` (`:384-390`); W05c1 columns `retired_at` on `config_policy_alert_rules`, `config_policy_monitoring_watches`, `alert_rules`, `alert_templates`; `managed_by_monitor_id` on `alert_rules`/`alert_templates` (`db/schema/alerts.ts:66,95`).
- Produces: every settings row keyed on a `monitors` link; a `monitors` link (`inline_settings = {items:[], inheritance:'cumulative', checkIntervalSeconds:<n>}`) for each policy that had only a `monitoring` link; `inline_settings->>'checkIntervalSeconds'` mirrored on every `monitors` link that owns a settings row; `RAISE WARNING` counts for everything still unretired.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementMigration.integration.test.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * W05d Task 1 — the re-key migration moves each policy's monitoring settings
 * row from its `monitoring` link to its `monitors` link (creating the link),
 * mirrors checkIntervalSeconds onto the link, and is a no-op on replay.
 * Real Postgres: the migration is SQL and the unique index on
 * feature_link_id is what makes the duplicate case interesting.

-- 1. Re-key config_policy_monitoring_settings from each policy's `monitoring`
--    link to its `monitors` link, creating the `monitors` link when absent.

-- 2. Mirror check_interval_seconds into the monitors link's inline_settings so
--    the JSONB mirror and the normalized row agree.
-- 3. Report what is still unretired. The boot-time TypeScript sweep
--    (services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts) converts or retires it;
--    SQL cannot — conversion compiles monitors and moves open alerts.

### Task 2: `monitors` inline settings carry `checkIntervalSeconds`; decompose/assemble own the settings row; Monitors tab writes it there (PR1)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/validators/monitors.ts` (lines 295-297)
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/validators/monitors.test.ts` (append after line 130)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts` (`decomposeInlineSettings` `case 'monitors'` line 1117-1130; `deleteNormalizedRows` `case 'monitors'` line 1245; `assembleInlineSettings` `case 'monitors'` line 1498-1512; `removeFeatureLink` lines 1887-1899)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.monitors.test.ts`
- Modify: Task 1's `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementMigration.integration.test.ts` (last-detachment history regression)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/MonitorsTab.tsx` (W05c2 Task 3's `saveAttachments(): Promise<boolean>`, `saveCheckInterval`, `handleSave`, and Task 4's inheritance payloads; `handleOverride` and the *Check interval* field)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/MonitorsTab.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `monitorsInlineSettingsSchema` (`{ items, inheritance }` after W05c1), `configPolicyMonitoringSettings`, `useFeatureLink(policyId).save(existingLinkId, { featureType, featurePolicyId, inlineSettings })`.
- Produces: `MonitorsInlineSettings.checkIntervalSeconds: number` (10–3600, default 60); `decomposeInlineSettings('monitors')` upserts `config_policy_monitoring_settings(feature_link_id, check_interval_seconds)`; `assembleInlineSettings('monitors')` returns `{ items, inheritance, checkIntervalSeconds }` (and returns a non-null object even when `items` is empty, because the interval is a value); `deleteNormalizedRows('monitors')` deletes attachments only; settings and historical watches survive. Empty saves keep existing links; removal of a settings-owning link clears attachments without deleting the link (D11).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Append to `packages/shared/src/validators/monitors.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('monitors inline settings — checkIntervalSeconds (W05d)', () => {
  it('defaults to 60 and accepts 10..3600', () => {
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.parse({ items: [] }).checkIntervalSeconds).toBe(60);
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.parse({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 10 }).checkIntervalSeconds).toBe(10);
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.parse({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 3600 }).checkIntervalSeconds).toBe(3600);
  });
  it('rejects out-of-range and non-integer values', () => {
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.safeParse({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 9 }).success).toBe(false);
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.safeParse({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 3601 }).success).toBe(false);
    expect(monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.safeParse({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 60.5 }).success).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

In `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.monitors.test.ts:161-236`, extend the existing `updateTx` helper's `insert(...).values(...)` return to support the settings upsert, and import `configPolicyMonitoringSettings` from `../db/schema`:
```ts
// Inside updateTx.insert(...).values(...), after calls.push(...):
return table === configPolicyMonitoringSettings
  ? { onConflictDoUpdate: vi.fn(async () => []) }
  : Promise.resolve([]);
```
Add these cases **inside** its existing update describe so `updateTx` is in scope. Public signatures are verified at `configurationPolicy.ts:1752-1758`; no private decompose/assemble exports are introduced.
```ts
it('upserts interval and never deletes settings during last detachment', async () => {
  const { tx, calls } = updateTx({
    id: 'link-mon', configPolicyId: 'policy-1', featureType: 'monitors',
    featurePolicyId: null, inlineSettings: { items: [{ monitorId: MONITOR_ID_1 }] },
  });
  vi.mocked(db.transaction).mockImplementation(async (fn: any) => fn(tx));
  await updateFeatureLink('link-mon', {
    inlineSettings: { items: [], inheritance: 'replace', checkIntervalSeconds: 60 },
  }, 'policy-1');
  expect(calls.filter(c => c.op === 'delete').map(c => c.table)).toEqual([configPolicyMonitors]);
  expect(calls).toContainEqual({ op: 'insert', table: configPolicyMonitoringSettings,
    values: { featureLinkId: 'link-mon', checkIntervalSeconds: 60 } });
});
```
Use this explicit additional select chain in the existing assemble describe (`:238-282`); the file already defines `selectWhereRows` and `selectOrderByRows` (`:50-65`):
```ts
it('assembles the interval and replace mode with no attachments', async () => {
  const settingsChain: any = {};
  settingsChain.from = vi.fn(() => settingsChain);
  settingsChain.where = vi.fn(() => settingsChain);
  settingsChain.limit = vi.fn(async () => [{ checkIntervalSeconds: 45 }]);
  vi.mocked(db.select)
    .mockReturnValueOnce(selectWhereRows([{ id: 'link-mon', configPolicyId: 'policy-1',
      featureType: 'monitors', featurePolicyId: null,
      inlineSettings: { items: [], inheritance: 'replace' } }]) as any)
    .mockReturnValueOnce(selectOrderByRows([]) as any)
    .mockReturnValueOnce(settingsChain);
  const [link] = await listFeatureLinks('policy-1');
  expect(link!.inlineSettings).toEqual({ items: [], inheritance: 'replace', checkIntervalSeconds: 45 });
});
```
Existing add/update tests must now distinguish inserts by table (the new settings insert is not an attachment). Supply the same `onConflictDoUpdate` return for `configPolicyMonitoringSettings`; queue the additional settings select in both existing assemble tests.

Append to Task 1's integration file, importing `configPolicyMonitoringWatches` from the schema and `updateFeatureLink, removeFeatureLink` from `../../services/configurationPolicy`. This checks the real cascading FKs, not only the mock calls:
```ts
it('last-detachment Save and the removal backstop retain retired watch history', async () => {
  const partner = await createPartner();
  const org = await createOrganization({ partnerId: partner.id });
  const { policyId } = await policyWithMonitoringLink(org.id, 60, false);
  await replayMigration(MIGRATION);
  await withDbAccessContext(SYSTEM_CTX, async () => {
    const [link] = await db.select().from(configPolicyFeatureLinks).where(and(
      eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.configPolicyId, policyId),
      eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.featureType, 'monitors')));
    const [settings] = await db.select().from(configPolicyMonitoringSettings)
      .where(eq(configPolicyMonitoringSettings.featureLinkId, link!.id));
    const [watch] = await db.insert(configPolicyMonitoringWatches).values({
      settingsId: settings!.id, watchType: 'service', name: 'Spooler',
      retiredAt: new Date(), retiredReason: 'operator',
    }).returning();
    await updateFeatureLink(link!.id, {
      inlineSettings: { items: [], inheritance: 'cumulative', checkIntervalSeconds: 60 },
    }, policyId);
    await removeFeatureLink(link!.id, policyId);
    expect(await db.select().from(configPolicyMonitoringWatches)
      .where(eq(configPolicyMonitoringWatches.id, watch!.id))).toEqual([watch]);
    expect(await db.select().from(configPolicyMonitoringSettings)
      .where(eq(configPolicyMonitoringSettings.id, settings!.id))).toHaveLength(1);
    const [saved] = await db.select().from(configPolicyFeatureLinks)
      .where(eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.id, link!.id));
    expect(saved!.inlineSettings).toMatchObject({ items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: 60 });
  });
});
```

In `MonitorsTab.test.tsx:1-61,121-138`, use its actual `saveMock`, `removeMock`, `clickSave`, and `baseProps` harness. Replace the last-detachment-removes-link case:
```tsx
it.each(['cumulative', 'replace'] as const)('last detachment saves an empty %s link', async (inheritance) => {
  render(<MonitorsTab {...baseProps} existingLink={{ id: 'link-1', featureType: 'monitors',

  expect(removeMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

Retain C2 Task 3's invalid-interval regression (no writes outside 10–3600), updating its fixtures to the `monitors` link. The changed-interval case above must call `saveMock` exactly once; no second `monitoring`-link save remains.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/validators/monitors.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementMigration.integration.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/configurationPolicy.monitors.test.ts
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/MonitorsTab.test.tsx
```
Expected: shared — `expected undefined to be 60`; api — `expected "spy" to be called with [configPolicyMonitoringSettings]`; web — body does not contain `checkIntervalSeconds` (or the field is posted at the `monitoring` link URL).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**

`packages/shared/src/validators/monitors.ts` (lines 295-297; keep W05c1's `inheritance` field):
```ts
export const monitorsInlineSettingsSchema = z.object({
  items: z.array(monitorAttachmentItemSchema).max(200).default([]),
  inheritance: z.enum(['cumulative', 'replace']).default('cumulative'),
  // W05d — the only per-policy agent-collection setting the retired
  // Service & Process tab carried. Stored normalized on
  // config_policy_monitoring_settings, keyed by THIS link.
  checkIntervalSeconds: z.number().int().min(10).max(3600).default(60),
});
```

`apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts`, `decomposeInlineSettings` `case 'monitors'` (line 1117):
```ts
    case 'monitors': {
      const parsed = monitorsInlineSettingsSchema.parse(s);
      if (parsed.items.length > 0) {
        await tx.insert(configPolicyMonitors).values(
          parsed.items.map((item, idx) => ({
            featureLinkId: linkId,
            monitorId: item.monitorId,
            enabled: item.enabled,
            overrides: item.overrides ?? null,
            sortOrder: item.sortOrder ?? idx,
          }))
        );
      }
      // W05d: the per-policy check interval lives on the settings row this
      // link owns (re-keyed from the retired `monitoring` link by
      // 2026-10-24-100000-legacy-alerting-retirement-sweep.sql). Upsert, so an
      // update that re-decomposes never loses the row's id — retired watches
      // (alert history) still hang off it via settings_id.
      await tx
        .insert(configPolicyMonitoringSettings)
        .values({ featureLinkId: linkId, checkIntervalSeconds: parsed.checkIntervalSeconds })
        .onConflictDoUpdate({
          target: configPolicyMonitoringSettings.featureLinkId,
          set: { checkIntervalSeconds: parsed.checkIntervalSeconds, updatedAt: new Date() },
        });
      break;
    }
```

`deleteNormalizedRows` `case 'monitors'` (line 1245) — delete attachments only, **not** the settings row (the upsert above owns it; deleting it would cascade the retired watches). Leave that arm as it is and add the comment:
```ts
    case 'monitors':
      // Attachments are replaced wholesale; the settings row is upserted by
      // decompose (W05d) and deliberately NOT deleted here — its retired
      // watches are alert history.
      await tx.delete(configPolicyMonitors).where(eq(configPolicyMonitors.featureLinkId, linkId));
      break;
```
The settings FK (`configurationPolicies.ts:386`) and watch FK (`:408`) both cascade. Preserve the link in `removeFeatureLink` too: the API/AI removal path must not bypass the empty-save protection.

`assembleInlineSettings` `case 'monitors'` (line 1498):
```ts
    case 'monitors': {
      const rows = await executor
        .select()
        .from(configPolicyMonitors)
        .where(eq(configPolicyMonitors.featureLinkId, linkId))
        .orderBy(asc(configPolicyMonitors.sortOrder));
      const [settingsRow] = await executor
        .select({ checkIntervalSeconds: configPolicyMonitoringSettings.checkIntervalSeconds })
        .from(configPolicyMonitoringSettings)
        .where(eq(configPolicyMonitoringSettings.featureLinkId, linkId))
        .limit(1);
      // An empty normalized attachment set is authoritative (including replace).
      return {
        items: rows.map((r) => ({
          monitorId: r.monitorId,
          enabled: r.enabled,
          overrides: r.overrides,
          sortOrder: r.sortOrder,
        })),
        checkIntervalSeconds: settingsRow?.checkIntervalSeconds ?? 60,
      };
    }
```
(W05c1 stores `inheritance` on the link's JSONB and merges it in its own arm — keep whatever it added; only the `checkIntervalSeconds` read is new.)

`apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/MonitorsTab.tsx`: W05c2 Task 3 added `saveAttachments(): Promise<boolean>` and a separate `saveCheckInterval`; Task 4 added inheritance to the attachment payload. Replace those exact functions, not the pre-C2 `handleSave` empty branch. Keep C2's string-valued input, validation, translated error, and reset effect; replace `readCheckInterval` and seed `savedCheckInterval` from the `monitors` links:
```tsx
function readCheckInterval(link: { inlineSettings?: unknown } | null | undefined): number | undefined {
  const v = (link?.inlineSettings as { checkIntervalSeconds?: unknown } | null | undefined)?.checkIntervalSeconds;
  return typeof v === 'number' && Number.isFinite(v) ? v : undefined;
}
const savedCheckInterval = readCheckInterval(existingLink) ?? readCheckInterval(parentLink) ?? CHECK_INTERVAL_DEFAULT;
const [checkInterval, setCheckInterval] = useState<string>(String(savedCheckInterval));
useEffect(() => { setCheckInterval(String(savedCheckInterval)); }, [savedCheckInterval]);
```
Replace `saveAttachments` in full. Even an existing empty link with a default interval can own historical watches; Save must retain it. The sole no-op is an absent link with empty cumulative attachments and the default interval, and it returns **`true`** to preserve C2's boolean contract:
```tsx
const saveAttachments = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  const checkIntervalSeconds = Number(checkInterval);
  if (!existingLink && items.length === 0 && checkIntervalSeconds === CHECK_INTERVAL_DEFAULT && inheritance === 'cumulative') return true;
  const result = await save(existingLink?.id ?? null, {
    featureType: 'monitors', featurePolicyId: null,
    inlineSettings: { items: buildPayloadItems(), inheritance, checkIntervalSeconds },
  });
  if (result) onLinkChanged(result, 'monitors');
  return !!result;
};

const handleSave = async () => {
  clearError();
  if (!validateCheckInterval()) return;
  if (!(await saveAttachments())) return;
};
```
Delete `saveCheckInterval` entirely: one Save now persists attachments, inheritance, and interval together. In `handleOverride`, keep `clearError()`, add `if (!validateCheckInterval()) return;`, and use `inlineSettings: { items: buildPayloadItems(), inheritance, checkIntervalSeconds: Number(checkInterval) }`. Replace `handleRemove` with an empty save as well, retaining the settings and the selected inheritance mode:
```tsx
const handleRemove = async () => {
  if (!existingLink) return;
  clearError();
  if (!validateCheckInterval()) return;
  const result = await save(existingLink.id, {
    featureType: 'monitors', featurePolicyId: null,
    inlineSettings: { items: [], inheritance, checkIntervalSeconds: Number(checkInterval) },
  });
  if (result) { onLinkChanged(result, 'monitors'); setItems([]); }
};
```
All writes use the existing `useFeatureLink.save` / `runAction` path. Delete `monitoringLink`, `readWatches`, and this tab's unused `siblingLinks` destructuring; retain the shared prop for other consumers. The interval input and validation retain C2's existing translated keys.

Replace `removeFeatureLink` (`configurationPolicy.ts:1887-1899`) with this service backstop. It locks the link before checking settings; mutations retain the existing transaction/context. A link owning settings is never deleted (D11). A zero-item replace link also stays an authoritative empty replacement.
```ts
export async function removeFeatureLink(linkId: string, configPolicyId: string) {
  return db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    const predicate = and(eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.id, linkId),
      eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.configPolicyId, configPolicyId));
    const [link] = await tx.select().from(configPolicyFeatureLinks).where(predicate).for('update');
    if (!link) return null;
    const [settings] = await tx.select().from(configPolicyMonitoringSettings)
      .where(eq(configPolicyMonitoringSettings.featureLinkId, linkId)).limit(1);
    const inline = (link.inlineSettings ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>;
    if (settings || (link.featureType === 'monitors' && inline.inheritance === 'replace')) {
      if (link.featureType !== 'monitors') {
        // Retired monitoring links can still own the duplicate settings row
        // reported by Task 1. Keep that history too.
        return link;
      }
      await tx.delete(configPolicyMonitors).where(eq(configPolicyMonitors.featureLinkId, linkId));
      const [updated] = await tx.update(configPolicyFeatureLinks).set({
        inlineSettings: { ...inline, items: [], checkIntervalSeconds: settings?.checkIntervalSeconds ?? 60 },
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      }).where(predicate).returning();
      return updated ?? null;
    }
    const [deleted] = await tx.delete(configPolicyFeatureLinks).where(predicate).returning();
    return deleted ?? null;
  });
}
```

### Task 3: Agent config builder reads the `monitors` link; policy watches leave the wire (PR1)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts` (`unionMonitoringWatches` 2163-2195 — delete; `resolveDeviceMonitoringSettings` 2197-2241; `resolvePolicyMonitoringSettings` 2243-2370)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.monitorWatchDelivery.test.ts`, `helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts` (lines 244-290 fixture, 465-516 `monitoring:` cases, 518-560 #2949 case), `heartbeat.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/monitorWatchDelivery.integration.test.ts`, `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/agentPolicyResolversPartnerWide.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType = 'monitors'`, `configPolicyMonitoringSettings.checkIntervalSeconds`, `resolveMonitorDerivedWatches(deviceId)` (2091), `MONITOR_ONLY_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (2070).
- Produces: `buildMonitoringConfigUpdate(deviceId): Promise<MonitoringConfigUpdate | null>` unchanged in signature and wire shape; `check_interval_seconds` from the winning `monitors` link's settings row (default 60); `watches` from monitors only. `resolvePolicyMonitoringSettings` now returns `{ check_interval_seconds: number } | null` (renamed `resolvePolicyCheckInterval`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** In `helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts`, change the `monitoring:` cases (465-516): remove the queued legacy-watch read and pin the actual feature predicate with the following test:

Add a hoisted `eqMock: vi.fn()` to the existing `vi.hoisted` object and destructuring (`helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts:47-90`), and use this partial mock (there is no existing drizzle mock):
```ts
vi.mock('drizzle-orm', async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import('drizzle-orm')>();
  eqMock.mockImplementation(actual.eq);
  return { ...actual, eq: eqMock };
});
import { configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks, configPolicyMonitoringWatches } from '../../db/schema';

it('reads the monitors interval without querying historical watches', async () => {
  dbMock._resetQueue([
    deviceRow, orgWithPartner, [],
    [{ level: 'partner', assignmentPriority: 1, checkIntervalSeconds: 90 }],
    deviceRow, orgWithPartner, [], [],
  ]);
  const result = await buildMonitoringConfigUpdate(DEVICE_ID);
  expect(result).toEqual({ check_interval_seconds: 90, watches: [] });
  const tables = dbMock.select.mock.results.map(r => r.value.from.mock.calls[0]?.[0]);
  expect(tables).not.toContain(configPolicyMonitoringWatches);
  expect(eqMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType, 'monitors');
  expect(eqMock).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType, 'monitoring');
});
```
`dbMock._resetQueue` and the thenable chains are real (`:47-73`); `deviceRow`, `orgWithPartner`, and `DEVICE_ID` are defined at `:236-244`. Do not add a mocked `feature: 'monitoring'` row and claim it proves exclusion: this harness does not evaluate SQL. In the existing monitor-watch integration fixture, move the interval's feature link to `monitors`; leave a retired watch beneath its settings row and assert the response contains only monitor-derived watches. Keep the resolver's current-context assertions and the monitor-derived response tests.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/agents/helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts src/routes/agents/helpers.monitorWatchDelivery.test.ts
```
Expected: `expected ['monitoring'] to deeply equal ['monitors']` and `expected [configPolicyMonitoringWatches…] not to contain …`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In `helpers.ts`:

1. Delete `unionMonitoringWatches` (2163-2195).
2. `resolveDeviceMonitoringSettings` (2197-2241):
```ts
async function resolveDeviceMonitoringSettings(deviceId: string): Promise<MonitoringConfigUpdate | null> {
  // W05d: monitors are the ONLY source of watches. The policy read supplies
  // one value — the per-policy check interval — from the `monitors` link.
  const policy = await resolvePolicyCheckInterval(deviceId);
  const monitorResult = await resolveMonitorDerivedWatches(deviceId);
  if (monitorResult.kind === 'device_missing') {
    console.warn(`[monitoring] device vanished mid-resolution, omitting monitoring update for device ${deviceId}`);
    return null;
  }
  // Null ONLY when no `monitors` link resolved AND no monitor produced a
  // watch. A resolved link with zero watches still returns `watches: []` —
  // the #2949 "stop watching" signal.
  if (!policy && monitorResult.watches.length === 0) return null;
  return {
    check_interval_seconds: policy?.check_interval_seconds ?? MONITOR_ONLY_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS,
    watches: monitorResult.watches,
  };
}
```
3. Rename `resolvePolicyMonitoringSettings` → `resolvePolicyCheckInterval(deviceId): Promise<{ check_interval_seconds: number } | null>`; in the join at 2305-2312 change `eq(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType, 'monitoring')` to `'monitors'`; delete steps 7 (the watches query, 2333-2369) and return `{ check_interval_seconds: winner.checkIntervalSeconds }`. Keep the `#4673 W03` comment about the caller's own context — it is still why no system escape is needed (the `config_policy_feature_links` partner-wide SELECT branch and the agent GUC do the work). Update the doc comment on `MONITOR_ONLY_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (2070): it is now the default when no `monitors` link resolves.
4. `MonitoringWatchConfig` and `MonitoringConfigUpdate` (2019-2036): unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/agents/helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts src/routes/agents/helpers.monitorWatchDelivery.test.ts src/routes/agents/heartbeat.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/monitorWatchDelivery.integration.test.ts src/__tests__/integration/agentPolicyResolversPartnerWide.integration.test.ts
```
Also confirm the Go side never learns anything: `cd agent && go test -race ./internal/monitoring/...` (no change expected; it is the wire-shape control).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.monitorWatchDelivery.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.partnerWidePolicies.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents/heartbeat.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/monitorWatchDelivery.integration.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/agentPolicyResolversPartnerWide.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(agents): monitoring_settings check interval reads the monitors link; policy watches leave the wire"
```

### Task 4: Boot-time system sweep + startup count check (PR1)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/loadSources.ts`, `legacyBaseline.ts` (W05c1 prerequisite files; watch source predicate after settings re-key)
- Test: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyBaseline.test.ts` (W05c1; keep its normalized-row, inherited-consumer and delivery-equivalence regressions)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts` (import block near line 170; the detached block after line 1871)
- Test (existing): `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`, `site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts` (allowlist if flagged)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `previewPartnerConversion(partnerId, auth): Promise<PartnerConversionPreview>`, `convertPartnerLegacy(partnerId, previewHash, auth)`, `retireSource(sourceTable, sourceId, reason, auth): Promise<{ conversionId: string }>` and `ConversionError` (W05c1); `createSystemAuthContext()` (`services/featureConfigResolver.ts:52`); `runOutsideDbContext`, `withSystemDbAccessContext` (`db/index.ts`); `captureException(err, c?, tags?)` (`services/sentry.ts:687`); `partners.settings` jsonb (`db/schema/orgs.ts:39`).
- Retirement scope: `retirePreviewRefusals` accepts only `config_policy_alert_rules`, `config_policy_monitoring_watches`, `alert_templates`, `automations`, and `config_policy_automations`. These are Task 6's five retired-runtime source tables; `network_monitors` is excluded even when a later W05e partner preview contains network refusals. Broad workflows remain excluded (D12).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  // services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts — W05d-local report type.
  export interface RetiredSource { sourceTable: ConversionSourceTable; sourceId: string; name: string; reason: string; policyId: string | null }
  // services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts
  export const LEGACY_ALERTING_RETIREMENT_VERSION = 1;
  export interface LegacyAlertingRemaining { configPolicyAlertRules: number; configPolicyMonitoringWatches: number }
  export interface RetirementRunResult { partners: number; converted: number; retired: number; failed: number; remaining: LegacyAlertingRemaining }
  export class LegacyAlertingUnretiredError extends Error { readonly remaining: LegacyAlertingRemaining }
  export async function listPartnersWithUnretiredLegacyAlerting(): Promise<string[]>;
  export async function sweepPartnerLegacyAlerting(partnerId: string): Promise<{ converted: number; retired: RetiredSource[] }>;
  export async function retirePreviewRefusals(preview: PartnerConversionPreview, auth: AuthContext): Promise<RetiredSource[]>;
  export async function checkLegacyAlertingRetired(): Promise<LegacyAlertingRemaining>;
  export async function runLegacyAlertingRetirement(): Promise<RetirementRunResult>;
  ```
  Marker: `partners.settings.legacyAlertingRetirement = { version: 1, sweptAt: ISO, converted: n, retired: n, unconvertible: RetiredSource[] (≤ 200) }`. Env opt-out: `BREEZE_LEGACY_ALERTING_SWEEP=false` (sweep skipped; the count check still runs).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.test.ts
```
Expected: `Failed to resolve import "./retirementSweep"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**

Keep C1's partner preview and conversion signatures unchanged (D3). The sweep first obtains the full, system-scoped partner preview and confirms its hash; C1 refuses any equivalence delta using the normalized baseline, preserves disabled state and rehomes broad workflows before returning. The sweep then retires only the preview's refused sources in the five-table allowlist below. Later W05e network refusals never enter W05d's retirement writes, counts or marker; their worker/rules still run. D20's missing network capability is a blocked preview, not a retirement reason. No per-rule ledger writes: standalone sources are the template-group `alert_templates` entries (D13). No retirement of the preserved workflow outcome (D12), no alert resolution (D15/D19), and no `retireUnconvertible` option on the public conversion endpoint.

**Watch source after re-key:** in **both** C1 `loadSources.ts` and the private `legacyBaseline.ts`, the join to settings accepts the old and new links:
```ts
// loadSources.ts (own feature links):
inArray(configPolicyFeatureLinks.featureType, ['monitoring', 'monitors'])
// legacyBaseline.ts (effective/inherited feature links):
inArray(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType, ['monitoring', 'monitors'])
```
Keep normalized `retired_at IS NULL`, enabled checks, assignment filters, inheritance and ordering unchanged. This also reads the duplicate old-link settings row reported by Task 1. Never substitute `resolveEffectiveConfig(...).features.alert_rule`: the actual evaluator joins normalized rows and can fall through a policy with no rule rows (`featureConfigResolver.ts:379-440`), whereas that public reader chooses link JSON (`configurationPolicy.ts:2493-2507`). D6 is a mandatory dependency: its retained baseline tests run after Tasks 7–9 delete public legacy readers.

**System actors:** `createSystemAuthContext()` remains an authorization context only; its synthetic `user.id` is never persisted. C1's write sites use `auth.scope === 'system' ? null : auth.user.id` for ledger, definition, generated-policy and automation user FKs (D7). `monitor_definitions.created_by` already permits null (`db/schema/monitorDefinitions.ts:91`); no W05d relaxation is needed. C1 owns any necessary idempotent relaxation for other written columns. Keep `migrateToConfigPolicies.ts` historical and unchanged until Task 13 deletes it.

Create `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/retirementSweep.ts`:
```ts
/**
 * W05d — boot-time retirement sweep for legacy alerting.
 *
 * Converts whatever the W05c release left unconverted (self-hosters who never
 * pressed "Convert everything"), retires the unconvertible rows with a reason,
 * and then counts what is still unretired so a skipped or failed sweep is loud
 * rather than silent. Mirrors ensureBuiltInMonitorsForAllPartners: called
 * WITHOUT an enclosing DB context, after the HTTP listener is up, one system
 * context (= one top-level transaction) per partner so one failure never
 * blocks the rest. Never refuses boot.

### Task 5: Pending endpoint lists unconvertible rows and the sweep outcome; banner shows them once (PR1)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.ts` (W05c1's `GET /pending` handler)
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.pending.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/loadSources.ts` (C1 prerequisite; `readRetirementReport` beside `countPendingConversions`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts` (Task 4; scoped report regressions)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionPendingBanner.tsx`, `ConversionPendingBanner.test.tsx`, `conversionApi.ts`, `conversionApi.test.ts` (W05c2 prerequisite-created)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/monitoring.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: W05c1 `GET /monitor-definitions/conversion/pending?orgId → { data: { policies: number; rows: number } }` (handler in `routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.ts`, backed by `countPendingConversions` in `conversion/loadSources.ts`); W05c2 `conversionPaths.pending(orgId)` in `components/monitoring/conversion/conversionApi.ts`; `partners.settings.legacyAlertingRetirement` (Task 4); `retired_reason` on the five source tables.
- Produces:
  ```ts
  interface PendingConversionResponse {
    policies: number; rows: number;                          // W05c1, unchanged (still wrapped in { data: … })
    unconvertible: Array<{ sourceTable: ConversionSourceTable; sourceId: string; name: string; reason: string; policyId: string | null; policyName: string | null; retiredAt: string }>; // ≤ 200, newest first
    sweep: { sweptAt: string; converted: number; retired: number } | null; // authorized partner-wide marker, null for org-specific reports
  }
  ```
  Web: banner variant "N legacy rules could not be converted — review" with an expandable list and **Dismiss**; dismissal is per viewer in `localStorage` under `breeze.legacyAlertingRetirement.dismissed:<viewerId>:<scopeId>:<sweptAt>` (a new sweep re-shows it), wrapped in try/catch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Create `apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.pending.test.ts` with a real Hono/mocked-service harness. C1 creates the subrouter/export; this avoids nonexistent `seedSelect`/`partnerAuth` helpers in the current monitor-route tests (`monitorDefinitions.test.ts:134-148,217-241`).
```ts
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import type { AuthContext } from '../middleware/auth';
import { createSystemAuthContext } from '../services/featureConfigResolver';
const h = vi.hoisted(() => ({ counts: vi.fn(), report: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('../middleware/auth', () => ({
  authMiddleware: async (_c: unknown, next: () => Promise<void>) => next(),
  requireScope: () => async (_c: unknown, next: () => Promise<void>) => next(),
  requirePermission: () => async (_c: unknown, next: () => Promise<void>) => next(),
  requireMfa: () => async (_c: unknown, next: () => Promise<void>) => next(),
}));
vi.mock('../services/monitors/conversion', () => ({
  countPendingConversions: h.counts, previewPolicyConversion: vi.fn(), previewPartnerConversion: vi.fn(),
  convertPolicy: vi.fn(), convertPartnerLegacy: vi.fn(), revertConversion: vi.fn(), retireSource: vi.fn(),
  listConversionLedger: vi.fn(), ConversionError: class extends Error {},
  ConversionPrerequisiteMissingError: class extends Error {},
}));
vi.mock('../services/monitors/conversion/loadSources', () => ({ readRetirementReport: h.report }));
vi.mock('../services/auditEvents', () => ({ writeRouteAudit: vi.fn() }));
import { monitorConversionRoutes } from './monitorDefinitions.conversion';
const ORG = '10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001';
const OTHER = '10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002';
function request(orgId = ORG) {
  const app = new Hono<{ Variables: { auth: AuthContext } }>();
  app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
    c.set('auth', { ...createSystemAuthContext(), scope: 'organization', orgId: ORG,
      canAccessOrg: (id: string) => id === ORG });
    await next();
  });
  app.route('/monitor-definitions/conversion', monitorConversionRoutes);
  return app.request(`/monitor-definitions/conversion/pending?orgId=${orgId}`);
}
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  h.counts.mockResolvedValue({ policies: 0, rows: 0 });
  h.report.mockResolvedValue({ unconvertible: [], sweep: null });
});
it('returns the report and passes the selected org to its authorized loader', async () => {
  const report = { unconvertible: [{ sourceTable: 'config_policy_alert_rules', sourceId: OTHER,
    name: 'Custom', reason: 'unconvertible:custom_condition', policyId: null, policyName: null,
    retiredAt: '2026-11-01T00:00:00.000Z' }], sweep: null };
  h.report.mockResolvedValue(report);
  const res = await request();
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  expect(await res.json()).toEqual({ data: { policies: 0, rows: 0, ...report } });
  expect(h.report).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ orgId: ORG }), ORG);
});
it('returns null for an absent sweep marker', async () => {
  const res = await request();
  expect((await res.json()).data.sweep).toBeNull();
});
it('denies another organization before reading the report', async () => {
  expect((await request(OTHER)).status).toBe(403);
  expect(h.report).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
In Task 4's live integration test, after retirement, use the real report loader under organization scope so Postgres exercises every qualified predicate. Add imports for `readRetirementReport`, `createSystemAuthContext`, and `type AuthContext` from their modules:
```ts
const otherOrg = await createOrganization({ partnerId: partner.id });
const orgAuth: AuthContext = { ...createSystemAuthContext(), scope: 'organization',
  orgId: org.id, partnerId: partner.id, accessibleOrgIds: [org.id],
  canAccessOrg: id => id === org.id,
  orgCondition: column => eq(column, org.id),
};
await withDbAccessContext({ scope: 'organization', orgId: org.id,
  accessibleOrgIds: [org.id], currentPartnerId: partner.id }, async () => {
  const report = await readRetirementReport(orgAuth, org.id);
  expect(report.unconvertible.map(row => row.sourceId)).toEqual([customId]);
  await expect(readRetirementReport(orgAuth, otherOrg.id)).rejects.toThrow('Organization access denied');
});
// A privileged caller selecting the other org must still get only that org.
await withDbAccessContext(SYSTEM_CTX, async () => {
  const report = await readRetirementReport(createSystemAuthContext(), otherOrg.id);
  expect(report.unconvertible).toEqual([]);
});
```

`ConversionPendingBanner.test.tsx`: C2's harness mocks `fetchPendingCounts` directly, not a raw fetch helper. Add `id: 'viewer-1'` to its `useAuthStore` mock's `user` shape, clear localStorage in beforeEach, and extend all existing pending fixtures with `unconvertible: [], sweep: null`:
```tsx
it('lists unconvertible rows after the sweep and dismisses per viewer (W05d)', async () => {
  fetchPendingCounts.mockResolvedValue({ policies: 0, rows: 0, sweep: { sweptAt: 's1', converted: 2, retired: 1 },
    unconvertible: [{ sourceTable: 'config_policy_alert_rules', sourceId: 'r1', name: 'Custom', reason: 'unconvertible:custom_condition', policyId: 'p', policyName: 'Servers', retiredAt: 's1' }] });
  render(<ConversionPendingBanner orgId="org-1" onReview={vi.fn()} />);
  expect(await screen.findByText(/1 legacy rule could not be converted/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /review/i }));
  expect(screen.getByText('Custom')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText(/Servers/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /dismiss/i }));
  expect(screen.queryByText(/could not be converted/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(window.localStorage.getItem('breeze.legacyAlertingRetirement.dismissed:viewer-1:org-1:s1')).toBe('1');
});
it('stays hidden when nothing is unconvertible', async () => {
  fetchPendingCounts.mockResolvedValue({ policies: 0, rows: 0, sweep: null, unconvertible: [] });
  render(<ConversionPendingBanner orgId="org-1" onReview={vi.fn()} />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(fetchPendingCounts).toHaveBeenCalled());
  expect(screen.queryByText(/could not be converted/i)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.pending.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionPendingBanner.test.tsx
```
Expected: `expected undefined to deeply equal [ObjectContaining…]` (api); `Unable to find an element with the text: /1 legacy rule could not be converted/` (web).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Add `readRetirementReport` to C1's `conversion/loadSources.ts` beside `countPendingConversions`. It reads ledger-owned retirements (D2/D13), including all five source-table variants, and applies both the caller's ownership ceiling and requested org in one place. Standalone rules are reported once under their template-group ledger entry, never as an unsupported `sourceTable: 'alert_rules'`. Use the original `configuration_policies` name, not `cp`, so qualified schema columns remain valid. There are no invented template/rule predicates or camel-casing helpers.

```ts
// Add to loadSources.ts imports: and, eq, isNull, isNotNull, or, sql from drizzle-orm;
// db from ../../../db; DbExecutor from ./legacyBaseline; monitorConversions, partners,
// configurationPolicies from ../../../db/schema; AuthContext from ../../../middleware/auth;
// canManagePartnerWidePolicies from ../../partnerWideAccess; ConversionSourceTable from ./types.
export async function readRetirementReport(auth: AuthContext, requestedOrgId: string | null,
  executor: DbExecutor = db) {
  if (requestedOrgId && !auth.canAccessOrg(requestedOrgId)) throw new Error('Organization access denied');
  const owner = auth.scope === 'system' ? sql`true` : or(
    and(isNotNull(monitorConversions.orgId), auth.orgCondition(monitorConversions.orgId) ?? sql`false`),
    canManagePartnerWidePolicies(auth) && auth.partnerId
      ? and(isNull(monitorConversions.orgId), eq(monitorConversions.partnerId, auth.partnerId))
      : sql`false`,
  );
  const selectedOrg = requestedOrgId ? eq(monitorConversions.orgId, requestedOrgId) : sql`true`;
  const rows = await executor.execute<{
    source_table: ConversionSourceTable; source_id: string; name: string; reason: string;
    policy_id: string | null; policy_name: string | null; retired_at: Date;
  }>(sql`
    WITH sources AS (
      SELECT 'config_policy_alert_rules' AS source_table, id, name, retired_reason, retired_at
      FROM config_policy_alert_rules
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'config_policy_monitoring_watches', id, COALESCE(display_name, name), retired_reason, retired_at
      FROM config_policy_monitoring_watches
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'alert_templates', id, name, retired_reason, retired_at FROM alert_templates
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'automations', id, name, retired_reason, retired_at FROM automations
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'config_policy_automations', id, name, retired_reason, retired_at FROM config_policy_automations
    )
    SELECT sources.source_table, sources.id AS source_id, sources.name,
           sources.retired_reason AS reason, sources.retired_at,
           ${configurationPolicies.id} AS policy_id, ${configurationPolicies.name} AS policy_name
      FROM ${monitorConversions}
      JOIN sources ON sources.id = ${monitorConversions.sourceId}
        AND sources.source_table = ${monitorConversions.sourceTable}
      LEFT JOIN ${configurationPolicies} ON ${configurationPolicies.id} = ${monitorConversions.policyId}
     WHERE ${owner} AND ${selectedOrg} AND ${monitorConversions.revertedAt} IS NULL
       AND sources.retired_at IS NOT NULL AND sources.retired_reason LIKE 'unconvertible:%'
       AND sources.retired_reason <> 'unconvertible:alert_workflow_kept'
     ORDER BY sources.retired_at DESC, sources.id
     LIMIT 200
  `);
  const unconvertible = rows.map(row => ({ sourceTable: row.source_table, sourceId: row.source_id,
    name: row.name, reason: row.reason, policyId: row.policy_id, policyName: row.policy_name,
    retiredAt: new Date(row.retired_at).toISOString() }));
  // Partner-wide marker counts must not leak other orgs' data to a scoped viewer.
  // Org-specific reports still list all their refused sources through the ledger.
  let sweep: { sweptAt: string; converted: number; retired: number } | null = null;
  if (!requestedOrgId && auth.partnerId && canManagePartnerWidePolicies(auth)) {
    const [partner] = await executor.select({ settings: partners.settings }).from(partners)
      .where(eq(partners.id, auth.partnerId)).limit(1);
    const marker = (partner?.settings as { legacyAlertingRetirement?: {
      sweptAt: string; converted: number; retired: number;
    } } | null)?.legacyAlertingRetirement;
    if (marker?.sweptAt) sweep = { sweptAt: marker.sweptAt, converted: marker.converted, retired: marker.retired };
  }
  return { unconvertible, sweep };
}
```
In `routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.ts`, import `readRetirementReport` from `../services/monitors/conversion/loadSources`. Keep C1's query validation, `auth.canAccessOrg` check and pending-count scope unchanged; replace its final return:
```ts
const report = await readRetirementReport(auth, orgId);
return c.json({ data: { policies: counts.policies, rows: counts.rows, ...report } });
```

In `conversionApi.ts`, widen `PendingCounts` to the `PendingConversionResponse` shape above (with `ConversionSourceTable` already defined there). `fetchPendingCounts` already unwraps the response without dropping fields; keep it. Test the full report round-trip in `conversionApi.test.ts`:
```ts
it('keeps retirement report fields when fetching pending counts', async () => {
  const data = { policies: 0, rows: 0, unconvertible: [], sweep: null };
  vi.mocked(fetchWithAuth).mockResolvedValue(new Response(JSON.stringify({ data })));
  await expect(fetchPendingCounts('org-1')).resolves.toEqual(data);
});
```
`ConversionPendingBanner.tsx`: keep the W05c2 "needs conversion" variant; add the retirement variant rendered when `data.unconvertible.length > 0` and `!isDismissed(viewerId, scopeId, data.sweep?.sweptAt ?? data.unconvertible[0]?.retiredAt ?? 'manual')`:
```tsx
const dismissKey = (viewerId: string, scopeId: string, sweptAt: string) => `breeze.legacyAlertingRetirement.dismissed:${viewerId}:${scopeId}:${sweptAt}`;
function isDismissed(viewerId: string, scopeId: string, sweptAt: string): boolean {
  try { return window.localStorage.getItem(dismissKey(viewerId, scopeId, sweptAt)) === '1'; } catch { return false; }
}
function dismiss(viewerId: string, scopeId: string, sweptAt: string) {
  try { window.localStorage.setItem(dismissKey(viewerId, scopeId, sweptAt), '1'); } catch { /* private window: render without persistence */ }
}
// The component assigns this JSX to retirementBanner when !hidden and data.unconvertible.length > 0.

Before C2's early return, add the state below (every hook precedes the return); change `if (!counts || counts.rows === 0) return null` to `if (!counts) return null`. The existing `counts.rows > 0` pending section and `retirementBanner` render as siblings. A zero pending count must not suppress retirement reports.
```tsx
const viewerId = useAuthStore(s => s.user?.id ?? 'anonymous');
const scopeId = orgId ?? (claims.status === 'resolved' ? claims.claims?.partnerId : null) ?? 'unscoped';
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
const [hidden, setHidden] = useState(false);
const data = counts;
const sweptAt = counts?.sweep?.sweptAt ?? counts?.unconvertible[0]?.retiredAt ?? 'manual';
useEffect(() => { setHidden(isDismissed(viewerId, scopeId, sweptAt)); setOpen(false); }, [viewerId, scopeId, sweptAt]);

This table uses C1's actual machine codes, including `custom_condition` (not `custom`) and `metric_without_kind` (not `process_count`). `fr-CA / fr-FR` means write the provided French translation into **both** locale files. `alert_workflow_kept` is not a retirement reason: C1 rehomes those workflows and Task 4 excludes them defensively. Unknown future codes use the translated `unknown` message and show the raw code as separate diagnostic text; do not manufacture another prefix.

### Task 6: Close Revert before removing a source's runtime (PR1)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/lifecycle.ts`, `lifecycle.test.ts` (C1 prerequisite-created; D4).
- Verify/modify: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/convert.ts` (C1 Task 15's `revertConversion`, pre-mutation lifecycle guard); verify `conversion/ledger.ts` and `ledger.test.ts` retain C1 Task 16's authorized, dependency-aware `revertable` projection and tests.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.test.ts` (C1 route harness `m.revert`, `request`, `SOURCE`).
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts` (Task 4 fixture; no-write regression).
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionLedger.test.tsx` (C2 prerequisite-created); verify `ConversionLedger.tsx` already honors `revertable` and refreshes on 409.
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/monitors.mdx`, `docs/release-notes/next-release-draft.md` (deadline; detailed retirement docs remain Task 14).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes D4 `isRevertAvailable(sourceTable: ConversionSourceTable): boolean`; D2 `ConversionLedgerEntry.revertable` from C1 Task 16's `listConversionLedger` (lifecycle, governance, ownership, and live target-conversion dependencies in `source_state`); C1 Task 15's `revertConversion(conversionId, auth)`; C2 Task 8's `ConversionLedger` uses `runAction` for Undo.
- Produces: false for `config_policy_alert_rules`, `config_policy_monitoring_watches`, `alert_templates`, `automations`, `config_policy_automations`; true for `network_monitors` (W05e owns that runtime's later lifecycle). Authorized requests for an unavailable source return `409 { error: 'conversion_revert_unavailable' }` before any source, monitor, attachment, alert, cooldown or ledger mutation. Do not remove broad rehomed workflows; this guard only prevents restoring retired source semantics.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Replace C1's always-available lifecycle test:
```ts
import { expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { isRevertAvailable } from './lifecycle';
import type { ConversionSourceTable } from './types';
it.each<ConversionSourceTable>([
  'config_policy_alert_rules', 'config_policy_monitoring_watches', 'alert_templates',
  'automations', 'config_policy_automations',
])('disallows restoring the retired %s runtime', source => {
  expect(isRevertAvailable(source)).toBe(false);
});
it('leaves the network runtime lifecycle to W05e', () => {
  expect(isRevertAvailable('network_monitors')).toBe(true);
});
```
In C1's existing route test harness, add:
```ts
it('returns the lifecycle conflict for an authorized Undo', async () => {
  m.revert.mockRejectedValueOnce(new ConversionError('conversion_revert_unavailable', 'Runtime retired'));
  const response = await request(`/${SOURCE}/revert`, 'POST');
  expect(response.status).toBe(409);
  expect(await response.json()).toMatchObject({ error: 'conversion_revert_unavailable' });
});
```
In Task 4's integration case, immediately after reading the converted source, definition and ledger (all still in `SYSTEM_CTX`), import `revertConversion` and append:
```ts
const original = { source: conv, definition: def, ledger: ledgers[0], attachment: attach };
await expect(revertConversion(ledgers[0]!.id, createSystemAuthContext()))
  .rejects.toMatchObject({ code: 'conversion_revert_unavailable' });
const [sourceAfter] = await db.select().from(configPolicyAlertRules).where(eq(configPolicyAlertRules.id, convertibleId));
const [definitionAfter] = await db.select().from(monitorDefinitions).where(eq(monitorDefinitions.id, def!.id));
const [ledgerAfter] = await db.select().from(monitorConversions).where(eq(monitorConversions.id, ledgers[0]!.id));
const [attachmentAfter] = await db.select().from(configPolicyMonitors).where(eq(configPolicyMonitors.id, attach!.id));
expect({ source: sourceAfter, definition: definitionAfter, ledger: ledgerAfter, attachment: attachmentAfter }).toEqual(original);
```
Use C2's real ledger test harness (`request`, `json`, `entry`); it already tests stale 409 handling. Add a case for each W05d source:
```tsx
it.each(['config_policy_alert_rules', 'config_policy_monitoring_watches', 'alert_templates',
  'automations', 'config_policy_automations'])('disables Undo for retired %s', async sourceTable => {
  request.mockResolvedValueOnce(json({ items: [{ ...entry, sourceTable, revertable: false }], nextCursor: null }));
  render(<ConversionLedger />);
  const undo = await screen.findByTestId('ledger-undo-c1');
  expect(undo).toBeDisabled();
  fireEvent.click(undo);
  expect(request.mock.calls.every(([, options]) => !options?.method || options.method === 'GET')).toBe(true);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/monitors/conversion/lifecycle.test.ts src/services/monitors/conversion/ledger.test.ts src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionLedger.test.tsx
```
C1's helper returns true, so the lifecycle test reports `expected true to be false` and live Revert mutates the source. The existing web guard test should already pass; the new server lifecycle closes the previously inferred runtime-loss path. Confirmed against `featureConfigResolver.ts:379-440`, `alertService.ts:1239-1372` and `routes/agents/helpers.ts:2333-2370`, whose legacy readers Tasks 3/8/9 remove.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** `lifecycle.ts`:
```ts
import type { ConversionSourceTable } from './types';
export function isRevertAvailable(sourceTable: ConversionSourceTable): boolean {
  return sourceTable === 'network_monitors';
}
```
Keep C1's guard inside `revertConversion` immediately **after** loading/authorizing the ledger and **before** its first write:
```ts
if (!isRevertAvailable(ledger.sourceTable)) {
  throw new ConversionError('conversion_revert_unavailable', 'This conversion cannot be reverted after its legacy runtime has been retired.');
}
```
In C1 Task 16's `ledger.ts`, retain `listConversionLedger`'s **full** `revertable` projection: the row is unreverted, `isRevertAvailable(r.sourceTable)` is true, `canMutateOrgWideGovernance(auth)` is true, the existing org/partner ownership gate passes, **and no target conversion referenced by the response's `source_state` remains live**. Retain C1's dependency lookup as well as the final predicate; the four lifecycle/governance/ownership checks alone are incomplete. Keep its `ledger.test.ts` regressions for a live target (false), a reverted target (subject to all remaining gates), and a target outside the current ledger page; dependency lookup must not be limited to the returned page. W05d changes only lifecycle availability, so an automation entry stays non-revertable after its target is restored because its runtime is retired here. C1 already includes the error code in `ConversionError` and maps it to 409; retain that branch. C2 Task 8 already renders `disabled={!row.revertable}` and catches 409 through `runAction`, then reloads the ledger. Do not introduce a second client-side source list or bypass the server guard. The browser keeps its existing translated unavailable message; no new locale key is needed here.

Add this exact documentation paragraph to `monitors.mdx` and the upgrade notes:
```md
Revert is available during W05c. Upgrading to W05d ends Revert for legacy alert rules, templates, watches and alert-triggered source automations because their legacy monitoring paths have been retired. Conversion history remains available; Undo is disabled for those entries and the API returns `409 conversion_revert_unavailable`. Review and revert conversions before upgrading if needed. Existing monitors and alert history remain intact.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.** Repeat Step 2; run `pnpm --filter @breeze/api build` and `pnpm --filter @breeze/web exec tsc --noEmit`. Confirm a blocked Revert leaves every snapshot unchanged and the ledger remains readable. Network Revert stays available until its own wave changes the contract.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/lifecycle.ts apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/lifecycle.test.ts apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/convert.ts apps/api/src/routes/monitorDefinitions.conversion.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts apps/web/src/components/monitoring/conversion/ConversionLedger.test.tsx apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/monitors.mdx docs/release-notes/next-release-draft.md
git commit -m "fix(monitors): disable conversion revert when the legacy runtime is retired"

### Task 7: `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` — shared constants, API parity, retired links filtered out of every listing and resolver (PR2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.ts` (lines 22-30)
- Create: `packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.test.ts`
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/constants/index.ts` (export the new names if it exports by name)
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts` (line 568)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/configFeatureTypes.ts` (re-export)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/policyBaselineDefaults.ts` (lines 62-81), `policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts` (lines 87-91)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/resolution.test.ts` (lines 13, 16)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts` (`listFeatureLinks` 1901-1905; link query in `resolveEffectiveConfigWithExecutor` 2394-2431; `PARTNER_LINKABLE_FEATURE_TYPES` 2650-2665; `validateFeaturePolicyExists` 2801-2835 and 2889-2897)
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts` (POST `/:id/features` prologue), `featureLinks.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `configFeatureTypeEnum` (`db/schema/configurationPolicies.ts:32`, unchanged — the Postgres enum keeps both values).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  // packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.ts
  export const CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES = ['patch','backup','security','maintenance','compliance','automation','event_log','software_policy','sensitive_data','peripheral_control','warranty','helper','remote_access','pam','onedrive_helper','vulnerability','device_lifecycle','monitors'] as const;
  export const RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES = ['alert_rule', 'monitoring'] as const;
  export type RetiredConfigFeatureType = typeof RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES[number];
  export function isRetiredConfigFeatureType(value: unknown): value is RetiredConfigFeatureType;
  ```
  `addFeatureLinkSchema.featureType = z.enum(CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES)`; `POST /configuration-policies/:id/features` with a retired `featureType` → `410 { error, hint, retiredFeatureType }`; `listFeatureLinks` and the effective-config resolver never return a retired link.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Create `packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.test.ts`:
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, isRetiredConfigFeatureType } from './configFeatureTypes';

describe('config feature types after the alerting consolidation (W05d)', () => {
  it('alert_rule and monitoring are retired, not canonical', () => {
    expect([...RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES]).toEqual(['alert_rule', 'monitoring']);
    for (const t of RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) expect(CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES as readonly string[]).not.toContain(t);
  });
  it('monitors stays canonical', () => { expect(CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES).toContain('monitors'); });
  it('isRetiredConfigFeatureType narrows', () => {
    expect(isRetiredConfigFeatureType('alert_rule')).toBe(true);
    expect(isRetiredConfigFeatureType('monitors')).toBe(false);
    expect(isRetiredConfigFeatureType(undefined)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```
Replace `policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts:87-91` with:
```ts
describe('CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES parity with DB enum (W05d: canonical ∪ retired)', () => {
  it('canonical plus retired matches configFeatureTypeEnum.enumValues exactly', () => {
    expect([...CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, ...RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES].sort())
      .toEqual([...configFeatureTypeEnum.enumValues].sort());
  });
  it('the two lists are disjoint and retired types have no baseline entry', () => {
    const baseline = getPolicyBaselineDefaults().map((e) => e.featureType);
    for (const t of RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) {
      expect(CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES as readonly string[]).not.toContain(t);
      expect(baseline).not.toContain(t);
    }
  });
});
```
Create `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts`. Use an explicitly defined select queue and mutation sentinel, matching the real chain shapes at `configurationPolicy.monitors.test.ts:50-65,162-198`; no private helper exports:
```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { beforeEach, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { PgDialect } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
const h = vi.hoisted(() => ({ rows: [] as unknown[][], predicates: [] as unknown[],
  mutate: vi.fn(() => { throw new Error('unexpected mutation'); }) }));
vi.mock('../db', () => {
  const executor: any = {
    select: vi.fn(() => {
      const rows = h.rows.shift() ?? [];
      const chain: any = {};
      chain.from = vi.fn(() => chain);
      chain.where = vi.fn((predicate: unknown) => { h.predicates.push(predicate); return chain; });
      chain.limit = vi.fn(async () => rows);
      chain.orderBy = vi.fn(async () => rows);
      chain.then = (resolve: (value: unknown) => unknown, reject: (error: unknown) => unknown) => Promise.resolve(rows).then(resolve, reject);
      return chain;
    }),
    update: h.mutate, delete: h.mutate, insert: h.mutate,
  };
  executor.transaction = async (fn: (tx: unknown) => unknown) => fn(executor);
  return { db: executor, runOutsideDbContext: (fn: () => unknown) => fn(),
    withDbAccessContext: (_ctx: unknown, fn: () => unknown) => fn(),
    withSystemDbAccessContext: (fn: () => unknown) => fn() };
});
import { listFeatureLinks, updateFeatureLink } from './configurationPolicy';
beforeEach(() => { h.rows.length = 0; h.predicates.length = 0; h.mutate.mockClear(); });
it('filters retired feature types in the list SQL', async () => {
  h.rows.push([]);
  expect(await listFeatureLinks('10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001')).toEqual([]);
  const query = new PgDialect().sqlToQuery(h.predicates[0] as never);
  expect(query.sql).toMatch(/feature_type.*not in/i);
  expect(query.params).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(['alert_rule', 'monitoring']));
});
it('filters retired types in the effective-link query too', () => {
  const source = readFileSync(new URL('./configurationPolicy.ts', import.meta.url), 'utf8');
  expect(source).toMatch(/notInArray\(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks\.featureType,\s*\[\.\.\.RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES\]\)/);
});
```
The SQL assertion tests the real predicate rather than pretending the mock filters rows. Keep the existing inheritance integration suite for runtime resolution coverage.
In `featureLinks.test.ts`:
```ts
it('POST /:id/features with a retired featureType is 410 with a pointer (W05d)', async () => {
  mfaState.satisfied = true;
  const res = await buildApp().request(`/${POLICY_ID}/features`, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ featureType: 'alert_rule', inlineSettings: { items: [] } }) });
  expect(res.status).toBe(410);
  expect(await res.json()).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ retiredFeatureType: 'alert_rule', hint: expect.stringContaining('/monitor-definitions') }));
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/constants/configFeatureTypes.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts
```
Expected: `Failed to resolve import` (no `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` export), then `expected ['alert_rule','monitors'] to deeply equal ['monitors']`, `expected 400 to be 410`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**

`packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.ts` (replace lines 22-30 and append):
```ts
export const CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES = [
  'patch', 'backup', 'security', 'maintenance',
  'compliance', 'automation', 'event_log', 'software_policy', 'sensitive_data',
  'peripheral_control', 'warranty', 'helper', 'remote_access', 'pam', 'onedrive_helper',
  'vulnerability', 'device_lifecycle',
  // #5289 — monitor definitions attached to a policy. The singular
  // 'monitoring' (service/process watches) and 'alert_rule' were retired by
  // the alerting consolidation (W05d) — see RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES.
  'monitors',
] as const;

export type ConfigFeatureType = typeof CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES[number];

/**
 * Feature types retired by the alerting consolidation
 * (docs/superpowers/specs/monitoring/2026-09-19-alerting-consolidation-design.md,

 * feature-link rows and their child rows (config_policy_alert_rules,
 * config_policy_monitoring_watches) stay as alert history (spec C4). Nothing
 * authors, resolves, lists, delivers or renders them; the api parity test
 * asserts canonical ∪ retired == enum and the two are disjoint.
 */
export const RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES = ['alert_rule', 'monitoring'] as const;
export type RetiredConfigFeatureType = typeof RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES[number];
export function isRetiredConfigFeatureType(value: unknown): value is RetiredConfigFeatureType {
  return typeof value === 'string' && (RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES as readonly string[]).includes(value);
}
```
`packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts:568` → `featureType: z.enum(CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES),` with `import { CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES } from '../constants/configFeatureTypes';` at the top (a pure leaf; no cycle). `apps/api/src/services/configFeatureTypes.ts` → `export { CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, isRetiredConfigFeatureType, type ConfigFeatureType, type RetiredConfigFeatureType } from '@breeze/shared/constants';`. `policyBaselineDefaults.ts`: delete the `alert_rule` (line 64) and `monitoring` (line 67) rows of `NOT_ENFORCED`. `resolution.test.ts`: delete lines 13 and 16.

`configurationPolicy.ts`:
```ts
// listFeatureLinks (1901)
const links = await executor
  .select()
  .from(configPolicyFeatureLinks)
  .where(and(
    eq(configPolicyFeatureLinks.configPolicyId, configPolicyId),
    // W05d — retired link rows stay for history; no reader sees them.
    notInArray(configPolicyFeatureLinks.featureType, [...RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES]),
  ));
```
In the link query inside `withDevicePartnerPolicyVisibility` (2426-2431) add the same predicate to the `.where(and(...))`:
```ts
    .where(and(
      sql`(${sql.join(targetConditions, sql` OR `)})`,
      notInArray(configPolicyEffectiveFeatureLinks.featureType, [...RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES]),
      ...buildRoleOsFilterConditions(device),
    ))
```
`PARTNER_LINKABLE_FEATURE_TYPES` (2654): delete `'alert_rule',`. `validateFeaturePolicyExists`: delete `featureType === 'alert_rule' ||` (2804) and the `: featureType === 'alert_rule' ? { table: alertRules, label: 'Alert rule' }` arm (2826-2827); delete `featureType === 'monitoring' ||` (2890). Drop the `alertRules` import if tsc reports it unused. Import `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` from `./configFeatureTypes` and `notInArray` from `drizzle-orm`.

`routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts` — before the POST's `zValidator('json', addFeatureLinkSchema)`:
```ts
export const RETIRED_FEATURE_TYPE_GONE = (featureType: string) => ({
  error: `Feature type "${featureType}" was retired by the alerting consolidation.`,
  hint: 'Author the condition as a monitor (POST /monitor-definitions) and attach it to the policy through the "monitors" feature link.',
  retiredFeatureType: featureType,
});
const rejectRetiredFeatureType = async (c: Context, next: Next) => {
  const body = await c.req.raw.clone().json().catch(() => null);
  const ft = (body as { featureType?: unknown } | null)?.featureType;
  if (isRetiredConfigFeatureType(ft)) return c.json(RETIRED_FEATURE_TYPE_GONE(ft), 410);
  await next();
};
// Insert only this middleware entry in the existing post chain at
// featureLinks.ts:114-121, after requireMfa and param validation and immediately
// before zValidator('json', addFeatureLinkSchema):
rejectRetiredFeatureType,
```
(PATCH takes no `featureType`; a PATCH on an existing retired link cannot happen because `listFeatureLinks` never surfaces its id — and `updateFeatureLink` refuses it in Task 8.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/constants/configFeatureTypes.test.ts src/validators/index_configpolicy.test.ts
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit     # expect errors ONLY in files Tasks 8, 9, 13 delete/modify — list them; nothing else may appear
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts src/routes/configurationPolicies/resolution.test.ts src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts src/services/configurationPolicy.inheritance.test.ts
```
The web build is red from here until Task 12 (its `Record<FeatureType, …>` maps still name the retired keys) — expected; PR2 is one branch.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.ts packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.test.ts packages/shared/src/constants/index.ts packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts apps/api/src/services/configFeatureTypes.ts apps/api/src/services/policyBaselineDefaults.ts apps/api/src/services/policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/resolution.test.ts apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts

```

### Task 8: Delete the `alert_rule` / `monitoring` service arms, the inline-rule test route and the legacy policy resolvers (PR2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts` — delete `decomposeInlineSettings` arms `case 'alert_rule'` (756-790) and `case 'monitoring'` (907-935); `assertDecomposableInlineSettings` arms (1165-1167, 1171-1173); `deleteNormalizedRows` arms (1198-1199, 1219-1233); `assembleInlineSettings` arms (1271-1291, 1430-1465); imports `alertRuleInlineSettingsSchema`, `monitoringInlineSettingsSchema`, `configPolicyAlertRules`, `configPolicyMonitoringWatches` if unused after; `updateFeatureLink` (1752) refuses a retired link.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.ts` — delete the `alert_rule`/`monitoring` validation blocks (273-300, 517-535) and `findOfflineDurationViolation` (+ its module if separate: `grep -rn findOfflineDurationViolation apps/api/src`).
- Delete: `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/alertRuleTest.ts` (+ its tests: `ls apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/alertRuleTest*.test.ts`); `testConfigPolicyAlertRuleSchema` in `routes/configurationPolicies/schemas.ts:15` and in `packages/shared/src/validators` (grep); mount at `routes/configurationPolicies/index.ts:5,19`.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/featureConfigResolver.ts` — delete `GoverningAlertRulePolicy` (257-296), `resolveGoverningAlertRulePolicyForDevice` (298-377), `resolveAlertRulesForDevice` (379-441) and now-unused imports.
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/index.test.ts` (route mount regression; absent on base).
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/featureLinkReaders.contract.test.ts` (if it lists `alertRuleTest.ts` or the resolver; grep).
- Modify/delete tests: `configurationPolicy.*.test.ts` cases that drive the two arms; `featureLinks.test.ts` alert_rule/monitoring cases; `featureConfigResolver.test.ts` alert-rule cases.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's `isRetiredConfigFeatureType`; C1/D6 `resolveLegacyBaseline(deviceId, executor)` (private converter baseline, retained).
- Produces: `updateFeatureLink(linkId, …)` throws `Error('Feature link <id> is retired (alert_rule); it cannot be edited')` → route maps to 410 with `RETIRED_FEATURE_TYPE_GONE`; no code path parses `alertRuleInlineSettingsSchema` / `monitoringInlineSettingsSchema` in the service or routes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** In `configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts` (Task 7 file), use its explicitly defined queue and sentinel:
```ts
it('updateFeatureLink refuses a retired link before any normalized write', async () => {
  h.rows.push([{ id: 'legacy-link', featureType: 'alert_rule', configPolicyId: 'policy-1' }]);
  await expect(updateFeatureLink('legacy-link', { inlineSettings: { items: [] } }, 'policy-1'))
    .rejects.toThrow('retired');
  expect(h.mutate).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it('the public assembler no longer queries legacy tables', () => {
  const source = readFileSync(new URL('./configurationPolicy.ts', import.meta.url), 'utf8');
  const assembler = source.slice(source.indexOf('async function assembleInlineSettings'), source.indexOf('export async function addFeatureLink'));
  expect(assembler).not.toContain("case 'alert_rule'");
  expect(assembler).not.toContain("case 'monitoring'");
});
```
In `featureLinks.test.ts`, use `buildApp`, `STUB_POLICY`, `POLICY_ID`, `LINK_ID`, and the mocks actually defined at lines 6–121:
```ts
it('PATCH on a retired link is 410 before the service writes', async () => {
  mfaState.satisfied = true;
  getConfigPolicyMock.mockResolvedValue({ ...STUB_POLICY,
    featureLinks: [{ id: LINK_ID, featureType: 'alert_rule' }] });
  const res = await buildApp().request(`/${POLICY_ID}/features/${LINK_ID}`, {
    method: 'PATCH', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ inlineSettings: {} }),
  });
  expect(res.status).toBe(410);
  expect(updateFeatureLinkMock).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
Create `routes/configurationPolicies/index.test.ts` as a mount contract (the actual mounts are `index.ts:5,19`):
```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { expect, it } from 'vitest';
it('does not import or mount the retired inline-rule test router', () => {
  const source = readFileSync(new URL('./index.ts', import.meta.url), 'utf8');
  expect(source).not.toMatch(/alertRuleTest/);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/configurationPolicy.retiredFeatureTypes.test.ts src/routes/configurationPolicies/featureLinks.test.ts src/routes/configurationPolicies/index.test.ts
```
Expected: `unexpected mutation` instead of the retirement refusal, a non-410 PATCH result, and a source-match failure for `alertRuleTest`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Delete the arms listed under **Files** (each `case` block in full, including its comments). In `updateFeatureLink` (1752), after the existing link lookup:
```ts
  if (isRetiredConfigFeatureType(existing.featureType)) {
    throw new Error(`Feature link ${linkId} is retired (${existing.featureType}); it cannot be edited`);
  }
```
In the PATCH route, after its authorized policy/link lookup and before validation or calling `updateFeatureLink`, return the same 410:
```ts
if (isRetiredConfigFeatureType(existingLink.featureType)) {
  return c.json(RETIRED_FEATURE_TYPE_GONE(existingLink.featureType), 410);
}
```
The service guard remains the backstop for non-HTTP callers. Delete the two obsolete validation blocks. `git rm apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies/alertRuleTest.ts` and its tests; remove the import and mount (`index.ts:5,19`); delete `testConfigPolicyAlertRuleSchema` from `schemas.ts:15` and from `packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts` (grep; delete its zod object). Keep `services/monitors/conversion/legacyBaseline.ts` and its tests: they read normalized rules/settings/watches directly through their supplied executor, including old/new settings links after Task 4. Delete no private conversion imports or normalized source tables. In `featureConfigResolver.ts` delete lines 257-441 (the two public exports and the type) and the `configPolicyAlertRules` import if unused. `alertService.ts:28` still imports `resolveAlertRulesForDevice` — Task 9 deletes that import; until then tsc is red on exactly that line (note it in the Task 8 commit body).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/configurationPolicy src/routes/configurationPolicies src/services/featureConfigResolver.test.ts src/services/featureLinkReaders.contract.test.ts src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyBaseline.test.ts
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -v "alertService.ts(28\|alertService.ts(12[0-9][0-9]\|alertService.ts(13[0-9][0-9]\|alertService.ts(14[0-9][0-9]" ; # only Task 9's file may remain red
```

### Task 9: Delete the second evaluation sweep and the config-policy cooldown branches (PR2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/alertService.ts` — delete `ConfigPolicyAlertRule` + `getApplicableRulesFromPolicy` (1193-1230), `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy` (1232-1372), `checkAutoResolveFromConfigPolicy` (1374-~1480, through the end of its function); the `resolveAlert` config-policy cooldown branch (742-756: keep the `else if (alert.ruleId)` body as the only branch); imports at 21 (`configPolicyAlertRules`), 27 (`isConfigPolicyRuleCooling`, `markConfigPolicyRuleCooldown`), 28 (`resolveAlertRulesForDevice`); the comment at 816.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/alertCooldown.ts` — delete lines 290-360 (`CONFIG_POLICY_COOLDOWN_PREFIX`, `buildConfigPolicyCooldownKey`, `isConfigPolicyRuleCooling`, `markConfigPolicyRuleCooldown`); **keep** the `':cpar:'` exclusion at 478 with a comment that stale keys expire on their own TTL.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/alertWorker.ts` — imports 13-18; `processEvaluateDevice` (254-275); `processCheckAutoResolve` (300-330); `isRelationNotFoundError`/`_configPolicyTableWarningLogged` (31-38) if unused after.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/offlineDetector.ts` — import 16; delete `triggerConfigPolicyOfflineAlerts` (476-520); `triggerOfflineAlerts` (522-…): drop the `configPolicyResult` uses (541-542, 566-568 and the later `fatalError` re-throw); `_configPolicyTableWarningLogged`/`isRelationNotFoundError` (83-90) if unused.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/offlineAlertEffects.ts` — import 5 (keep `alertRuleOwnershipConditionForOrg`), delete 49-50; `prepareRule` (61-70): `rule.policy` is always false now — remove the `policy` discriminator from `OfflineRulePlan` and the `configPolicyAlertRules` table switch. **Coordinate with #6342:** that fix added monitor resolution here; keep it, delete only the `getApplicableRulesFromPolicy` half.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/alerts.ts` (import 22; delete 1082-1088), `apps/api/src/routes/mobile.ts` (import 23; delete 1251-1256).
- Tests: delete `apps/api/src/jobs/offlineDetector_configPolicy.test.ts`; modify `alertWorker.test.ts`, `alertQueue.test.ts`, `offlineDetector.dbcontext.test.ts`, `offlineDetector_reeval.test.ts`, `alertService.test.ts`, `alertService.autoResolveOutcome.test.ts`, `alertService.resolveCas.test.ts`, `routes/alerts/alerts.test.ts`, `alerts.resolveCas.test.ts`, `routes/mobile.resolveCas.test.ts`, `mobile.ackCas.test.ts`, `__tests__/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts` (the grep list in Ordering assumptions) — every mock of a deleted export goes; every "config policy branch" case is replaced by one asserting the branch is absent.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: `evaluateDeviceAlerts` is the only device sweep; `checkAllAutoResolve` the only auto-resolve; `alertCooldown.ts` exports no `cpar` functions; `alerts.config_policy_id` is read only by history/detail views (`routes/alerts/alerts.ts` GET paths, `alertService.createSourcedAlert` no longer writes it).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** In `alertWorker.test.ts`, use the existing `workerState.processor` harness (`:130-132,324-340`) and retain its system-context assertion:
```ts
it('evaluate-device runs only the monitor/standalone evaluator', async () => {
  createAlertWorker();
  const service = await import('../services/alertService');
  vi.mocked(service.evaluateDeviceAlerts).mockResolvedValue(['a1']);
  // Keep this temporary spy until Step 3 removes its export and mock.
  vi.mocked(service.evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy).mockResolvedValue([]);
  const result = await workerState.processor!({ data: {
    type: 'evaluate-device', deviceId: 'device-1', orgId: 'org-1',
  } });
  expect(result).toMatchObject({ alertsCreated: 1 });
  expect(service.evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
In Step 3, remove the temporary legacy mock/spy and replace its assertion with this permanent production import contract (add `readFileSync` from `node:fs`):
```ts
expect(readFileSync(new URL('./alertWorker.ts', import.meta.url), 'utf8'))
  .not.toMatch(/evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy|checkAutoResolveFromConfigPolicy/);
```
`alertService.resolveCas.test.ts` has `WINNER`, `updateReturnResults` and `dbMock._selectResults` (`:62-81`), not `seedAlert`. Import `setCooldown` from `./alertCooldown` and add:
```ts
it('resolving history-only policy alerts does not read their source or write cooldown', async () => {
  vi.mocked(setCooldown).mockClear();
  dbMock.select.mockClear();
  updateReturnResults.push([{ ...WINNER[0], configPolicyId: 'legacy-source', ruleId: null }]);
  await expect(resolveAlert('alert-1')).resolves.toBe(true);
  expect(setCooldown).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  const tables = dbMock.select.mock.results.map(result => result.value.from.mock.calls[0]?.[0]);
  expect(tables).not.toContain(configPolicyAlertRules);
});
```
Import `configPolicyAlertRules` from `../db/schema` in that test (the mock's table token is already supplied). Make its existing `from` callable a spy so the table assertion is real:
```ts
// In dbMock.select at alertService.resolveCas.test.ts:9-11:
from: vi.fn(() => ({ where: () => ({ limit: () => Promise.resolve(selectResults.shift() ?? []) }) })),
```
Keep its CAS winner/loser and published-event cases.
`offlineDetector_reeval.test.ts`: the "config policy offline alerts" case becomes "triggerOfflineAlerts evaluates standalone offline rules only and never imports the policy evaluator". `routes/alerts/alerts.resolveCas.test.ts` / `mobile.resolveCas.test.ts`: the `configPolicyId` cooldown case asserts no cooldown call.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/alertWorker.test.ts src/services/alertService.resolveCas.test.ts src/jobs/offlineDetector_reeval.test.ts src/routes/alerts/alerts.resolveCas.test.ts src/routes/mobile.resolveCas.test.ts
```
Expected: `expected {…} not to have property "evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy"`, `expected "spy" not to be called`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** `alertWorker.ts` `processEvaluateDevice` (254-275) becomes:
```ts
  try {
    const alertIds = await evaluateDeviceAlerts(data.deviceId);
    if (alertIds.length > 0) {
      console.log(`[AlertWorker] Created ${alertIds.length} alerts for device ${data.deviceId}`);
    }
    return { deviceId: data.deviceId, alertsCreated: alertIds.length, durationMs: Date.now() - startTime };
  } catch (error) {
```
`processCheckAutoResolve` (300-330): keep only `const resolvedCount = await checkAllAutoResolve(data.orgId);` and the log. Imports (13-18): `evaluateDeviceAlerts, checkAllAutoResolve` only; drop `alerts`, `isNotNull` if unused.

`offlineDetector.ts`: delete `triggerConfigPolicyOfflineAlerts`; in `triggerOfflineAlerts` replace lines 541-542 with `let alertCreated = false;` and delete the `configPolicyResult.fatalError` throws (566-568 and any later one); doc comment (522-535) becomes "Evaluates legacy standalone `alertRules` with offline conditions. Config-policy inline rules were retired (W05d); monitors of kind `offline` fire through `offlineAlertEffects` (#6342)."

`offlineAlertEffects.ts`: delete lines 49-50; `OfflineRulePlan` loses `policy`; `prepareRule`'s `const table = rule.policy ? configPolicyAlertRules : alertRules;` becomes `alertRules` and the `if (rule.policy) { maintenance … }` block is deleted (the standalone path never honoured maintenance here — unchanged behaviour). Keep #6342's monitor branch untouched.

`alertService.ts`: delete the three functions and the type; `resolveAlert` (742-756):
```ts
  // Set a cooldown after resolution so the condition must persist beyond the
  // window before a new alert is created. Legacy config-policy alerts
  // (config_policy_id set, rule_id null) are history-only since W05d: nothing
  // evaluates their source, so no cooldown is written for them.
  if (alert.ruleId) {
    const [rule] = await db.select().from(alertRules).where(eq(alertRules.id, alert.ruleId)).limit(1);
    if (rule) {
      const [template] = await db.select().from(alertTemplates)
        .where(eq(alertTemplates.id, rule.templateId)).limit(1);
      const overrides = rule.overrideSettings as Record<string, unknown> | null;
      await setCooldown(alert.ruleId, alert.deviceId,
        (overrides?.cooldownMinutes as number) ?? template?.cooldownMinutes ?? 15);
    }
  }
```
`routes/alerts/alerts.ts` 1082-1088 and `routes/mobile.ts` 1251-1256: delete the `else if (alert.configPolicyId) { … }` branch; drop `markConfigPolicyRuleCooldown` from the imports (22 / 23). `alertCooldown.ts`: delete 290-360; at 478:
```ts
    // ':cpar:' keys were written by the retired config-policy evaluator (W05d);
    // none are written any more and the survivors expire on their own TTL.
    const filteredKeys = keys.filter(k => !k.includes(':adaptive:') && !k.includes(':cpar:'));
```

### Task 10: Remove the transitional legacy delivery override (PR2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.ts` (W05b: `DeliverySource` union, `ResolveDeliveryInput.legacyOverride`, precedence step 3)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.test.ts` (W05b prerequisite-created).
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/delivery/describeDelivery.ts`, `describeDelivery.test.ts` (W05b prerequisite-created description map).
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyDeliveryBaseline.ts`, `legacyDeliveryBaseline.test.ts`.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/equivalence.ts` (C1 prerequisite; private before-delivery call).
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.tsx` (W05b prerequisite-created type mirror).
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts` (W05b's `legacyOverride` construction — the `alert.ruleId` unmanaged branch and the `alert.configPolicyId` branch — and the `legacyOverride` argument to `resolveDelivery`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.test.ts` (+ `notificationDispatcher.*.test.ts` siblings that seed `configPolicyAlertRules` or `overrideSettings.notificationChannelIds`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/delivery.ts` (W05b preview endpoint) only if it accepted a `legacyOverride`-shaped query (it should not; verify with grep).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: W05b `resolveDelivery`.
- Produces: `DeliverySource = 'monitor_none' | 'monitor_channels' | 'routing_rule' | 'default_row' | 'none'`; `ResolveDeliveryInput` has no `legacyOverride`; the dispatcher passes `{ orgId, severity, monitorId, kind, siteId }` only. Post-removal escalation order is `monitor → row → null` (monitor `deliveryMode = 'none'` still suppresses escalation). Removing this legacy arm is where a legacy rule's explicit escalation stops applying to active dispatch; every source must already be converted or retired by then. A queued legacy alert now uses routing without its old override; document that boundary in the release notes (Task 14).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** In W05b's `resolveDelivery.test.ts`, use its actual `selectQueue`, `row`, `ORG`, `PARTNER`, `CH_ORG`, `ESC_MON` fixtures. Remove active legacy-override precedence expectations and add:
```ts
it.each(['routing_rule', 'default_row', 'none'] as const)(
  'does not inherit legacy escalation in the %s result', async source => {
    selectQueue.push([{ partnerId: PARTNER }]);
    selectQueue.push(source === 'none' ? [] : [row({
      id: 'retirement-row', isDefault: source === 'default_row',
      channelIds: [CH_ORG], escalationPolicyId: null,
    })]);
    // @ts-expect-error the public legacyOverride input is retired in W05d
    const out = await resolveDelivery({ orgId: ORG, severity: 'high', legacyOverride: { escalationPolicyId: ESC_MON } });
    expect(out).toMatchObject({ source, escalationPolicyId: null, skippedChannelIds: [] });
  },
);
it('ignores stale legacy channel overrides in the public resolver', async () => {
  selectQueue.push([{ partnerId: PARTNER }], [row({ channelIds: [CH_ORG] })]);
  // @ts-expect-error removed from the public API
  const out = await resolveDelivery({ orgId: ORG, severity: 'high', legacyOverride: { channelIds: [] } });
  expect(out.channelIds).toEqual([CH_ORG]);
  expect(out.skippedChannelIds).toEqual([]);
});
```
The API typecheck is what validates `@ts-expect-error`; Vitest alone does not run TypeScript diagnostics. Keep W05b's monitor escalation and skipped-channel parity cases.

Create `services/monitors/conversion/legacyDeliveryBaseline.test.ts` for the retained private conversion baseline. This is deliberately separate from active delivery: the sweep must compare the old behavior even after active dispatch has been retired.
```ts
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
vi.mock('../../delivery/resolveDelivery', () => ({ resolveDelivery: vi.fn() }));
import { resolveDelivery } from '../../delivery/resolveDelivery';
import { resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline } from './legacyDeliveryBaseline';
import type { DbExecutor } from './legacyBaseline';
it('preserves override precedence, eligibility and independent escalation in the private baseline', async () => {
  vi.mocked(resolveDelivery).mockResolvedValue({ channelIds: ['route-channel'], skippedChannelIds: [],
    escalationPolicyId: 'route-escalation', source: 'default_row' });
  const execute = vi.fn(async () => [{ id: 'old-channel', reason: 'disabled' }]);
  const executor = { execute } as unknown as DbExecutor;
  expect(await resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline({ orgId: 'org', severity: 'high' },
    { channelIds: ['old-channel'], escalationPolicyId: 'old-escalation' }, executor)).toEqual({
      channelIds: [], skippedChannelIds: [{ id: 'old-channel', reason: 'disabled' }], escalationPolicyId: 'old-escalation',
    });
  expect((await resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline({ orgId: 'org', severity: 'high' },
    { channelIds: [], escalationPolicyId: 'old-escalation' }, executor)).escalationPolicyId).toBe('old-escalation');
  expect(resolveDelivery).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ monitorId: null, kind: null }), executor);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/delivery/resolveDelivery.test.ts src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyDeliveryBaseline.test.ts
```
Expected: routing/default/none still inherit `ESC_MON`; the new private helper import cannot resolve. The dispatcher tests from W05b/C1 must still cover alerts queued before retirement and prove no legacy source lookups after implementation.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In the public `resolveDelivery.ts`, remove the input, union member, channel branch and declaration of `legacyEscalation`. Replace **every** fallback expression, retaining W05b's `finish(...)` eligibility wrapper and `skippedChannelIds` (D1):
```ts
// Routing-rule return:
escalationPolicyId: monitorEscalation ?? rule.escalationPolicyId ?? null,
// Default-row return:
escalationPolicyId: monitorEscalation ?? defaultRow.escalationPolicyId ?? null,
// No-row return:
return finish({ channelIds: [], escalationPolicyId: monitorEscalation ?? null, source: 'none' });
```
Remove `'legacy_override'` from `DeliverySource`, from `services/delivery/describeDelivery.ts`'s description map and its legacy-specific tests, and from W05b Task 14's `Answer.source` union in `apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.tsx`. Keep both eligible destinations and skipped-channel metadata in the mirror. Delete active dispatcher construction of legacy overrides and both normalized/standalone legacy lookups; retain its compiled-monitor identification. No live dispatcher path reads `configPolicyAlertRules` or unmanaged `overrideSettings` for delivery.

Create `services/monitors/conversion/legacyDeliveryBaseline.ts`. It is private to conversion and replaces C1's **before** comparison's call that passed `legacyOverride` to `resolveDelivery`; the proposed-monitor **after** comparison still calls the public resolver. This preserves a truthful comparison after deleting the active branch, and retains kind-less legacy routing semantics. Its historical escalation comparison keeps D22's explicit legacy policy ahead of the routing policy, including when legacy channels are inherited:
```ts
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { db } from '../../../db';
import type { DbExecutor } from './legacyBaseline';
import { resolveDelivery, type ResolveDeliveryInput, type ResolvedDelivery } from '../../delivery/resolveDelivery';
type LegacyOverride = { channelIds?: string[] | null; escalationPolicyId?: string | null };
export async function resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline(input: ResolveDeliveryInput,
  override: LegacyOverride | null, executor: DbExecutor = db): Promise<
    Pick<ResolvedDelivery, 'channelIds' | 'skippedChannelIds' | 'escalationPolicyId'>> {
  const channelIds = [...new Set(override?.channelIds ?? [])];
  if (channelIds.length > 0) {
    // Same eligibility contract as W05b; configured override wins even if all
    // its channels are disabled. Falling through would invent notifications.
    // Ordinary reads retain this executor's RLS scope; use the same owner
    // predicate for system dispatch and org preview (D21).
    const rows = await executor.execute<{ id: string; reason: 'disabled' | null }>(sql`
      SELECT channel.id, CASE WHEN channel.enabled THEN NULL ELSE 'disabled' END AS reason
      FROM notification_channels AS channel
      JOIN organizations AS org ON org.id = ${input.orgId}::uuid
      WHERE channel.id = ANY(${channelIds}::uuid[])
        AND (channel.org_id = org.id
          OR (channel.org_id IS NULL AND channel.partner_id = org.partner_id))
    `);
    const byId = new Map(rows.map(row => [row.id, row.reason]));
    const skippedChannelIds: ResolvedDelivery['skippedChannelIds'] = [];
    const eligible = channelIds.filter(id => {
      const reason = byId.has(id) ? byId.get(id)! : 'unavailable';
      if (reason === null) return true;
      skippedChannelIds.push({ id, reason }); return false;
    });
    return { channelIds: eligible, skippedChannelIds, escalationPolicyId: override?.escalationPolicyId ?? null };
  }
  const resolved = await resolveDelivery({ ...input, kind: null, monitorId: null }, executor);
  return { channelIds: resolved.channelIds, skippedChannelIds: resolved.skippedChannelIds,
    escalationPolicyId: override?.escalationPolicyId ?? resolved.escalationPolicyId ?? null };
}
```
In C1's `equivalence.ts`, retain its existing signature hash and add an optional fourth argument to its actual `effectiveSignature` helper. Import `resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline` from `./legacyDeliveryBaseline`:
```ts
async function effectiveSignature(p: ProposedMonitor, input: Parameters<typeof resolveDelivery>[0],
  executor: DbExecutor, legacy?: Parameters<typeof resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline>[1]) {
  const resolved = legacy === undefined
    ? await resolveDelivery(input, executor)
    : await resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline(input, legacy, executor);
  return sha(canonical({
    behavior: monitorSignature({ ...p, deliveryMode: 'channels',
      deliveryChannelIds: resolved.channelIds, escalationPolicyId: resolved.escalationPolicyId }),
    skippedChannelIds: [...resolved.skippedChannelIds].sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id)),
  }));
}
```
In `signatureMapForLegacy`, replace the inline-rule call with:
```ts
for (const p of item!.proposed) out.set(`rule:${row.id}:${p.role}`, await effectiveSignature(p, {
  orgId: device.orgId, siteId: device.siteId, severity: p.severity, kind: null,
}, executor, { channelIds: row.notificationChannelIds, escalationPolicyId: row.escalationPolicyId }));
```
Pass an empty override object as argument four for watches:
```ts
for (const p of mapped.proposed) out.set(`watch:${row.id}:${p.role}`, await effectiveSignature(p,
  { orgId: device.orgId, siteId: device.siteId, severity: p.severity, kind: null }, executor, {}));
```
Monitor calls in `signatureMapForMonitors` keep three arguments and use the public resolver. Any remaining legacy sources in the dry-run **after** set still use the private helper too. Preserve C1's per-device/site iteration, canonical channel/escalation comparison and delivery freshness hash; no public reader becomes the before baseline.

### Task 11: Legacy write routers → 410 Gone, reads retained (PR2)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/legacyAlertingGone.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/rules.ts` — `POST /rules` (272-477), `PUT /rules/:id` (479-729), `DELETE /rules/:id` (731-806), `POST /rules/:id/test` (808-~900) replaced; `createAlertRuleSchema`/`updateAlertRuleSchema`/`testAlertRuleSchema` imports and helpers used only by them deleted (`canAccessRuleTargets` stays if a GET uses it — grep).
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alertTemplates/templates.ts` — `POST /templates` (215-320), `PATCH /templates/:id` (353-431), `DELETE /templates/:id` (433-486) replaced; `createTemplateSchema`/`updateTemplateSchema` imports deleted; `assertTemplateWriteAccess`-style helpers (95-108) deleted if unused.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alertTemplates/rules.ts` — `POST /rules` (128-227), `PATCH /rules/:id` (261-360), `DELETE /rules/:id` (362-417), `POST /rules/:id/toggle` (419-491) replaced.
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/alertTemplates/schemas.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/alerts/schemas.ts` — delete the write schemas that no longer have a consumer (grep each name across `apps/api/src` first; `packages/shared` validators stay).
- Tests: `routes/alerts/rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts`, `rules.authz.test.ts`, `rules.testVerdict.test.ts` (delete — it tested `POST /rules/:id/test`), `rules.conditionTypes.test.ts` (delete the POST cases), `alertTemplates/templates.managedByMonitor.test.ts`, `templates.guard.test.ts`, `templates.authz.test.ts`, `alertTemplates/rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts`, `rules.authz.test.ts`, `conditionTypes.test.ts` — write cases assert 410; read cases (`rules.list.test.ts`, `rules.siteScope.test.ts`, `templates.scope.test.ts`, `templates.siteScope.test.ts`, `siteScope.test.ts`) unchanged.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `requireScope`, `requireAlertWrite`, `requireMfa` (existing middleware on each replaced route — kept so an unauthenticated caller still gets 401, not 410).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  // apps/api/src/routes/legacyAlertingGone.ts
  export const LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE = {
    error: 'This endpoint was retired by the alerting consolidation.',
    message: 'Alert conditions are authored as monitors. Create, update and delete through /api/v1/monitor-definitions; attach a monitor to a configuration policy through its "monitors" feature link. Read endpoints for legacy rows remain for alert history.',
    docs: 'https://docs.breezermm.com/features/monitors/',
  } as const;
  export const legacyAlertingGone = (c: Context) => c.json(LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE, 410);
  ```
  `POST /alerts/rules/:id/test` is also 410 (D19); its replacement is `POST /monitor-definitions/:id/test` (`routes/monitorDefinitions.ts:727-729`). Every `POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE` under `/alerts/rules*` and `/alert-templates/templates*`, `/alert-templates/rules*` returns 410 with that body after auth + scope + write-permission + MFA middleware. `GET`s are untouched. `/alert-templates/correlations*` (correlation rules — a different object, not an alert-authoring surface) is untouched.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Keep the existing files and their real harnesses. In `routes/alerts/rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts:9-89`, retain `authRef`, `grantedRef`, the auth/db/helper mocks, `makeApp()` and beforeEach. Import `LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE` from `../legacyAlertingGone`; replace the old 409 write cases inside its describe:
```ts
it.each([
  ['POST', '/alerts/rules'],
  ['PUT', `/alerts/rules/${RULE_ID}`],
  ['DELETE', `/alerts/rules/${RULE_ID}`],
  ['POST', `/alerts/rules/${RULE_ID}/test`],
])('%s %s is retired', async (method, path) => {
  const response = await makeApp().request(path, { method,
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: method === 'DELETE' ? undefined : '{}' });
  expect(response.status).toBe(410);
  expect(await response.json()).toEqual(LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE);
});
it('auth still precedes retirement', async () => {
  authRef.current = null as never;
  expect((await makeApp().request('/alerts/rules', { method: 'POST', body: '{}' })).status).toBe(401);
});
it('write permission still precedes retirement', async () => {

});
```
`alertTemplates/templates.managedByMonitor.test.ts:55-60` and `rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts:72-77` both define **`app()`** (no `testApp` module). Replace their write cases using those existing harnesses:
```ts
// templates.managedByMonitor.test.ts — import ../legacyAlertingGone.
it.each([['POST', '/alert-templates/templates'], ['PATCH', `/alert-templates/templates/${TEMPLATE_ID}`],
  ['DELETE', `/alert-templates/templates/${TEMPLATE_ID}`]])('%s %s is retired', async (method, path) => {
  const response = await app().request(path, { method, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
    body: method === 'DELETE' ? undefined : '{}' });
  expect(response.status).toBe(410);
  expect(await response.json()).toEqual(LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE);
});
// rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts — import ../legacyAlertingGone.
it.each([['POST', '/alert-templates/rules'], ['PATCH', `/alert-templates/rules/${RULE_ID}`],
  ['DELETE', `/alert-templates/rules/${RULE_ID}`], ['POST', `/alert-templates/rules/${RULE_ID}/toggle`]])(
  '%s %s is retired', async (method, path) => {
    const response = await app().request(path, { method, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      body: method === 'DELETE' ? undefined : '{}' });
    expect(response.status).toBe(410);
    expect(await response.json()).toEqual(LEGACY_ALERTING_GONE);
  });
```
Keep the existing scope/site/GET/correlation tests as the read-path controls; the write-only harnesses do not mock list queries.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/alerts/rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts src/routes/alertTemplates/templates.managedByMonitor.test.ts src/routes/alertTemplates/rules.managedByMonitor.test.ts
```
Expected: `Failed to resolve import "../legacyAlertingGone"`, then `expected 400 to be 410` (zod rejects `{}` before any handler today).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Create `legacyAlertingGone.ts` as in **Interfaces** (`import type { Context } from 'hono'`). Replace each route body, keeping its middleware chain and dropping the `zValidator` (a 410 must not depend on the body parsing):
```ts
// routes/alerts/rules.ts — replaces 272-477, 479-729, 731-806, 808-~900
rulesRoutes.post('/rules', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
rulesRoutes.put('/rules/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
rulesRoutes.delete('/rules/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
rulesRoutes.post('/rules/:id/test', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertRead, legacyAlertingGone);
```
```ts
// routes/alertTemplates/templates.ts — replaces 215-320, 353-431, 433-486
templateRoutes.post('/templates', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
templateRoutes.patch('/templates/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
templateRoutes.delete('/templates/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
```
```ts
// routes/alertTemplates/rules.ts — replaces 128-227, 261-360, 362-417, 419-491
ruleRoutes.post('/rules', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
ruleRoutes.patch('/rules/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
ruleRoutes.delete('/rules/:id', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
ruleRoutes.post('/rules/:id/toggle', requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'), requireAlertWrite, requireMfa(), legacyAlertingGone);
```
Keep the exact middleware each route had on `main` (the lines quoted above are what `rules.ts:272-277`, `templates.ts:215-220`, `alertTemplates/rules.ts:128-133, 419-424` carry today). Then delete the now-unreferenced helpers, schemas and imports until `tsc` and `eslint` are clean. **Do not touch** `monitorCompiler.ts` — compiled monitors write `alert_rules`/`alert_templates` through the service, not these routes (spec §Non-goals).

Also delete the web-side writer that only these routes served: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertRuleForm.tsx`, `AlertRuleForm.retiredCondition.test.tsx`, and its export in `components/alerts/index.ts` (nothing imports it after W05a; `grep -rn "AlertRuleForm" apps/web/src` must print nothing afterwards).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/alerts/rules src/routes/alertTemplates src/routes/alerts/helpers
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec eslint src/routes/alerts/rules.ts src/routes/alertTemplates/templates.ts src/routes/alertTemplates/rules.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add -A apps/api/src/routes/legacyAlertingGone.ts apps/api/src/routes/alerts apps/api/src/routes/alertTemplates apps/web/src/components/alerts
git commit -m "feat(api): legacy alert rule and template write endpoints return 410 Gone; reads retained"
```

### Task 12: Web — delete the policy Alerts / Service & Process tabs and `/alerts/rules`; hash aliases; parity tests; i18n (PR2)

**Files:**
- Delete: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/AlertRuleTab.tsx`, `AlertRuleTab.test.tsx`, `AlertRuleTab.testVerdict.test.tsx`, `AlertRuleTestModal.tsx`, `MonitoringTab.tsx`, `MonitoringTab.test.tsx`
- Delete: `apps/web/src/components/monitoring/LegacyRulesPage.tsx`, `LegacyRulesPage.test.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/types.ts` (lines 61, 65)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/ConfigPolicyDetailPage.tsx` (imports; icons 112, 123; `VALID_TABS` 140-148; `useHashTab` 158-170; render cases 432, 442)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/ConfigPolicyDetailPage.test.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/featureTypeParity.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.tsx` (lines 120, 127), `DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.featureParity.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/pages/alerts/rules/index.astro`, `new.astro`, `[id].astro`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.tsx` (lines 10, 46), `AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx` (lines 26-37)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/settingsPageRegistry.test.ts` only if it lists `/alerts/rules` (grep)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/policies.json` (remove `…alertRuleTab` block, en 201-266, and `…monitoringTab` block, en 799-837), `pages.json` (`titles.alertsRules`, line 32), `alerts.json` (`alertsTabStrip.tabs.rules`, en 622; `list.*` block at en ~370-378 if only `LegacyRulesPage` read it — grep each key)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` / `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` (from `@breeze/shared`); `useHashTab` (`lib/useHashState.ts:77`).
- Produces: `FEATURE_META` and `featureTabIcons` keyed by the new `FeatureType`; `LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES: Record<'alert_rule' | 'monitoring', 'monitors'>` exported from `ConfigPolicyDetailPage.tsx`; a deep link to `#alert_rule` / `#monitoring` lands on `#monitors` with the URL rewritten via `history.replaceState`; `/alerts/rules`, `/alerts/rules/new`, `/alerts/rules/:id` → `301 /alerts/monitors`; `AlertsTabStrip` shows Alerts · Correlations · Monitors · Delivery (W05b already replaced Channels with Delivery — keep its list; only the Rules entry goes).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** `featureTypeParity.test.ts` — replace the last case with:
```ts
it('every canonical type has a tab and no retired type does (W05d)', () => {
  expect([...EDITOR_EXCLUDED_FEATURE_TYPES]).toEqual([]);
  expect(Object.keys(FEATURE_META).sort()).toEqual([...CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES].sort());
  for (const retired of RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) {
    expect(FEATURE_META).not.toHaveProperty(retired);
    expect(FEATURE_TYPES as readonly string[]).not.toContain(retired);
  }
});
it('legacy hashes alias to the monitors tab', () => {
  expect(LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES).toEqual({ alert_rule: 'monitors', monitoring: 'monitors' });
  for (const k of Object.keys(LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES)) expect(RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES).toContain(k);
});
```
`DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.featureParity.test.ts` — add:
```ts
it('renders no retired feature type (W05d)', () => {
  for (const retired of RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) expect(ALL_FEATURE_TYPES as readonly string[]).not.toContain(retired);
});
```
`ConfigPolicyDetailPage.test.tsx` — add (follow the file's existing render/mocks; `window.location.hash` is settable in jsdom):
```tsx
it.each(['#alert_rule', '#monitoring'])('deep link %s lands on the Monitors tab and rewrites the hash', async (hash) => {
  window.location.hash = hash;
  const replace = vi.spyOn(window.history, 'replaceState');
  render(<ConfigPolicyDetailPage policyId="p1" />);
  expect(await screen.findByRole('tab', { name: /monitors/i, selected: true })).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(replace).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.anything(), '', expect.stringMatching(/#monitors$/));
  expect(window.location.hash).toBe('#monitors');
});
```
`AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx` — delete the `Regras`/`Rules` expectations (lines 30, 33-37) and add:
```tsx
it('has no Rules tab (W05d)', () => {
  render(<AlertsTabStrip />);
  expect(screen.queryByRole('link', { name: 'Rules' })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getAllByRole('link').map((a) => a.getAttribute('href'))).toEqual(['/alerts', '/alerts/correlations', '/alerts/monitors', '/alerts/delivery']);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/configurationPolicies/featureTabs/featureTypeParity.test.ts src/components/devices/DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.featureParity.test.ts src/components/configurationPolicies/ConfigPolicyDetailPage.test.tsx src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx
```
Expected: `expected {…} not to have property "alert_rule"`, `LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES is not exported`, `Unable to find role="tab" … selected`, `expected null not to be in the document` (Rules link present).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**
`git rm` the six tab files and the two `LegacyRulesPage` files. `types.ts`: delete lines 61 and 65 (`alert_rule`, `monitoring` rows) — `FeatureType` is `Exclude<ConfigFeatureType, …>`, so the `Record<FeatureType, …>` compiles again once the rows go. `ConfigPolicyDetailPage.tsx`: delete the two imports, icon rows 112 and 123, render cases 432 and 442, and add:
```tsx
// Hashes of the tabs retired by the alerting consolidation (W05d). A saved
// deep link, a docs link or the contextual-help button may still carry them;
// they land on the Monitors tab and the URL is rewritten so the next reload
// is clean. Keys are RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES — featureTypeParity.test.ts
// asserts that.
export const LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES: Record<'alert_rule' | 'monitoring', Tab> = {
  alert_rule: 'monitors',
  monitoring: 'monitors',
};

// inside the component, right after `const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useHashTab<Tab>(VALID_TABS, "overview");`
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return;
  const raw = window.location.hash.replace(/^#/, '');
  const alias = (LEGACY_TAB_ALIASES as Record<string, Tab | undefined>)[raw];
  if (!alias) return;
  window.history.replaceState(window.history.state, '', `${window.location.pathname}${window.location.search}#${alias}`);
  setActiveTab(alias);
}, [setActiveTab]);
```
(`useHashTab` ignores an unknown hash and starts on `overview`; the effect runs post-mount, same timing `useHashState` uses to adopt the hash — see the #2421 note at lines 158-161.) `DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.tsx`: delete lines 120 and 127. Astro pages:
```astro
---
// W05d — the legacy rules page was absorbed into Monitors.
return Astro.redirect('/alerts/monitors', 301);
---
```
for all three `pages/alerts/rules/*.astro`. `AlertsTabStrip.tsx`: delete line 10 and line 46. Locales: delete the listed blocks/keys in all 8 files (the coverage test fails on a key present in one locale and absent in another, in either direction). Run `grep -rn "alertRuleTab\|monitoringTab\|alertsRules\|LegacyRulesPage\|alerts/rules" apps/web/src` — must print nothing except the three 301 stubs.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/web exec tsc --noEmit
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/configurationPolicies src/components/devices/DeviceEffectiveConfigTab src/components/alerts/AlertsTabStrip.test.tsx src/lib/__tests__/settingsPageRegistry.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts src/locales
pnpm --filter @breeze/web build     # Astro must compile the three redirect stubs
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add -A apps/web/src/components/configurationPolicies apps/web/src/components/monitoring apps/web/src/components/devices apps/web/src/components/alerts apps/web/src/pages/alerts/rules apps/web/src/locales apps/web/src/lib/__tests__
git commit -m "feat(web): retire the policy Alerts and Service & Process tabs and /alerts/rules; legacy hashes land on Monitors"
```

### Task 13: AI tools refuse the retired feature types; `manage_alert_rules` loses `list_templates`; the one-shot migrate script goes (PR2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts` (`VALIDATED_INLINE_SETTINGS` 101-108; `manage_policy_feature_link` description 876-905 incl. the `alert_rule`/`monitoring` shape paragraphs at 879-880; JSON-schema `featureType.enum` 907-916; handler `add` branch 1000-1014; `update` anti-bypass 956-994)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFleet.ts` (`manage_alert_rules` 2450-2520 description/schema/`list_templates` branch; `list_rules` branch ~2521-2560; refusal text 2579-2583; `manage_service_monitors` `list` 3170-3215 if W05c2 left the `monitoring` join)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemasFleet.ts:164-185`, `aiAgentSdkTools.ts:1999-2014` and `:2347-2357`, `aiToolSchemas.ts:1386`, `aiGuardrails.ts:1005-1010`, `aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts:67-74, 88-89`, `mcpGuidance.ts:92-101`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts` (line 378 case), `aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts`, `aiToolsFleet.test.ts`, `aiToolSchemasFleet.test.ts`
- Delete: `apps/api/src/scripts/migrateToConfigPolicies.ts`; entry at `apps/api/src/services/featureLinkReaders.contract.test.ts:83`
- Delete (shared, now importer-less): `alertRuleInlineSettingsSchema`, `monitoringInlineSettingsSchema` and their types in `packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts` (+ cases in `index_configpolicy.test.ts`) — only after `grep -rn "alertRuleInlineSettingsSchema\|monitoringInlineSettingsSchema" apps packages --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' | grep -v node_modules` shows no consumer outside the validator file and its test.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` / `isRetiredConfigFeatureType`; the W05c2 warning text for `alert_rule`/`monitoring` (replaced by a refusal).
- Produces:
  - `manage_policy_feature_link` `add` with `featureType` in `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` → `{ error: 'Feature type "alert_rule" was retired by the alerting consolidation. Author the condition with manage_monitor_definitions and attach it to the policy with featureType "monitors".', retiredFeatureType, useTool: 'manage_monitor_definitions' }`; its JSON-schema `featureType.enum` is `[...CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES]`; `update` on a retired link → the same error (the anti-bypass read at 967-974 already fetches the existing link's type).
  - `manage_alert_rules` actions: `list_rules | get_rule | test_rule | list_channels | alert_summary` (no `list_templates`; `create_rule`/`update_rule`/`delete_rule` dropped from every schema, not just refused); `list_rules` returns rows with `managed_by_monitor_id IS NOT NULL` only and each row carries `monitorId`; every pointer says `manage_monitor_definitions`.
  - No file under `apps/api/src/scripts/` inserts `config_policy_alert_rules`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** `aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts` — import `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` from `./configFeatureTypes` and `configFeatureTypeEnum` from `../db/schema/configurationPolicies`, then replace the case at line 378:
```ts
it('manage_policy_feature_link accepts every canonical feature type and refuses every retired one', () => {
  for (const ft of CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) {
    expect(validateToolInput('manage_policy_feature_link', { action: 'add', configPolicyId: '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000', featureType: ft, inlineSettings: {} }).success).toBe(true);
  }
  for (const ft of RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES) {
    expect(validateToolInput('manage_policy_feature_link', { action: 'add', configPolicyId: '00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000', featureType: ft, inlineSettings: {} }).success).toBe(false);
  }
  // The DB enum still carries the retired values; the tool surface must not.
  expect([...CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES, ...RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES].sort()).toEqual([...configFeatureTypeEnum.enumValues].sort());
});
it('manage_alert_rules has no list_templates and no write actions (W05d)', () => {
  const schema = aiTools.get('manage_alert_rules')!.definition.input_schema as { properties: { action: { enum: string[] } } };
  expect(schema.properties.action.enum).toEqual(['list_rules', 'get_rule', 'test_rule', 'list_channels', 'alert_summary']);
  expect(aiTools.get('manage_alert_rules')!.definition.description).toContain('manage_monitor_definitions');
  expect(aiTools.get('manage_alert_rules')!.definition.description).not.toMatch(/featureType "alert_rule"/);
});
```
`aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts`:
```ts
it('add with a retired featureType is refused with a pointer, before any DB read', async () => {
  const tools = new Map<string, any>();
  registerConfigPolicyTools(tools);
  vi.mocked(db.select).mockClear();
  const out = JSON.parse(await tools.get('manage_policy_feature_link')!.handler({ action: 'add', configPolicyId: POLICY_ID, featureType: 'monitoring', inlineSettings: { checkIntervalSeconds: 60, watches: [] } }, makeAuth()));
  expect(out).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ retiredFeatureType: 'monitoring', useTool: 'manage_monitor_definitions' }));
  expect(db.select).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
`aiToolsFleet.test.ts:641-658` defines `tool` and `mockAuth` inside its `manage_alert_rules handler` describe. Use those actual fixtures. Add a hoisted spy for `isNotNull`, preserving all other Drizzle exports, and extend its existing alertRules schema mock (`:139`) with `managedByMonitorId: 'managedByMonitorId'`:
```ts
const { isNotNullMock } = vi.hoisted(() => ({ isNotNullMock: vi.fn() }));
vi.mock('drizzle-orm', async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import('drizzle-orm')>();
  isNotNullMock.mockImplementation(actual.isNotNull);
  return { ...actual, isNotNull: isNotNullMock };
});
import { alertRules } from '../db/schema';
// Add inside the existing describe, where tool/mockAuth are defined:
it('list_rules requests managed rows only', async () => {
  isNotNullMock.mockClear();
  const result = JSON.parse(await tool.handler({ action: 'list_rules' }, mockAuth));
  expect(result.rules).toEqual([]); // existing mock returns an empty result
  expect(isNotNullMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(alertRules.managedByMonitorId);
});
it('list_templates is no longer an action', async () => {
  const result = JSON.parse(await tool.handler({ action: 'list_templates' }, mockAuth));
  expect(result.error).toMatch(/unknown action/i);
});
```
The predicate assertion checks SQL construction; keep the existing tenant/site-scoping suites as isolation controls. `registerConfigPolicyTools`, `makeAuth`, `POLICY_ID`, and `db` in the preceding test are the real definitions at `aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts:129-162`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expect FAIL.**
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts src/services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.test.ts src/services/aiToolsFleet.test.ts
```
Expected: `expected true to be false` (retired type accepted), `expected ['list_templates', …] to deeply equal ['list_rules', …]`, `expected ['r1','r2'] to deeply equal ['r1']`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**
`aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts`: delete the `alert_rule` and `monitoring` rows of `VALIDATED_INLINE_SETTINGS` (103-104); delete the two shape paragraphs (879-880) and add one line to the description: `- alert_rule / monitoring: RETIRED. Author conditions with manage_monitor_definitions and attach them via featureType "monitors".`; replace the hand-listed enum (908-916) with `enum: [...CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES]`; in the `add` branch, before the `ORG_SCOPED_ONLY_FEATURE_TYPES` check (1007):
```ts
        if (isRetiredConfigFeatureType(featureType)) {
          return JSON.stringify({
            error: `Feature type "${featureType}" was retired by the alerting consolidation. Author the condition with manage_monitor_definitions and attach it to the policy with featureType "monitors".`,
            retiredFeatureType: featureType,
            useTool: 'manage_monitor_definitions',
          });
        }
```
and in the `update` path, after `existingFeatureType` is read (974), the same refusal keyed on `existingFeatureType`. Delete W05c2's warning branch for the two types.

`aiToolsFleet.ts` `manage_alert_rules` (2450-2520): description → `'Query alert rules and notification channels (read-only). Every alert condition is authored as a monitor — use manage_monitor_definitions to create, change or delete one; list_rules shows the rules monitors compiled (each carries monitorId). Actions: list_rules, get_rule, test_rule, list_channels, alert_summary.'`; `action.enum` → the five actions; delete the `category` property and the whole `if (action === 'list_templates') { … }` block; in `list_rules` add `isNotNull(alertRules.managedByMonitorId)` to `conditions` and `monitorId: alertRules.managedByMonitorId` to the projection; replace the 2579-2583 refusal with the generic unknown-action fallthrough the handler already ends with (the three actions are no longer in any schema). `manage_service_monitors` `list` (3170-3215): if W05c2 left the `monitoring`-link join, delete it — the resolver read is the only one. `aiToolSchemasFleet.ts:165` and `aiAgentSdkTools.ts:2002`: the five-action enum; drop `templateId`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `overrideSettings`, `isActive`, `name`, `category` and the `create_rule` refinement (183). `aiAgentSdkTools.ts:2353` and `aiToolSchemas.ts:1386` already derive from `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` (unchanged). `aiGuardrails.ts:1006`: delete `list_templates`. `aiAgentSystemPrompt.ts:70`: drop `alert_rule, monitoring` from the inline-settings list; `:74`: the watches example becomes a `manage_monitor_definitions` example; `:88`: `manage_alert_rules (read-only, compiled rules)`. `mcpGuidance.ts:101`: `Core alert conditions as monitors (manage_monitor_definitions, attached via the policy's "monitors" feature link): …`.

`git rm apps/api/src/scripts/migrateToConfigPolicies.ts`; delete `featureLinkReaders.contract.test.ts:83`. Delete the two shared schemas only when the grep in **Files** is clean.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit

### Task 14: Docs and release notes (PR2)

**Files:**
- Verify only: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/service-monitoring.mdx` is absent and `apps/docs/astro.config.mjs` retains W05c2's redirect (base sidebar entry at `:126`; W05c2 removes it). Do not delete the file again.
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/alerts.mdx` (sections at 116-170 "Creating Alert Rules", "Testing a Rule", "Partner-wide Rules", and 240 "Offline Duration for Configuration Policy Rules")
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/configuration-policies.mdx` (lines 107, 375)
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/monitors.mdx` (lines 35, 104-118 "Converting a legacy alert rule", 157 API row, 169-173 troubleshooting)
- Modify: `docs/release-notes/next-release-draft.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (`[Unreleased]`)
- Verify only: W05c2's ten migration guides already point authoring at Monitors. This wave edits retirement-specific documentation only.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: W05c2's docs state (`alert-templates.mdx` already removed with a redirect; `alerts.mdx` already the three-facet domain page if W05c2 rewrote it — `git log --oneline -3 -- apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/alerts.mdx`).
- Produces: retirement-specific docs while preserving W05c2's `/features/service-monitoring/` → `/features/monitors/` redirect; no docs page instructs a reader to open a policy's **Alerts** or **Service & Process Monitoring** tab, `/alerts/rules`, or `POST /alerts/rules`; the `featureType` list at `configuration-policies.mdx:375` equals `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES`; release notes carry the removals, the boot check and what self-hosters see.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing check.** Docs have no unit tests; the red is the build plus a grep contract. Add to `apps/docs/package.json` scripts (if a `check:links`-style script does not already exist) nothing — instead run the grep as the assertion:
```bash
grep -rn "Service & Process Monitoring tab\|/features/service-monitoring\|/alerts/rules\|POST /alerts/rules\|Alerts tab\|alert_rule\b" apps/docs/src/content/docs --include='*.mdx' | grep -v "retired\|no longer" 
```
Expected before the change: remaining W05c retirement instructions in the three feature docs. These base line anchors shift after W05c2; its redirect is already correct. Expected after: no output.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL** on remaining retirement-specific instructions. W05c2's deletion/redirect is already green; do not manufacture another missing-sidebar failure.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** Verify the prerequisite deletion and redirect without changing either:
```bash
test ! -e apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/service-monitoring.mdx
rg -n "'/features/service-monitoring/': '/features/monitors/'" apps/docs/astro.config.mjs
```
The first command exits zero; the second prints W05c2's redirect. Edit only the retirement instructions below; retain the Task 6 Revert deadline.

`configuration-policies.mdx:107` → `A single policy carries every alert condition — service and process watches, thresholds, offline detection, event-log patterns — as monitors attached on its **Monitors** tab, plus one agent-collection setting, *Check interval*. See [Monitors](/features/monitors/).` `:375` → the canonical list without `alert_rule`/`monitoring`, ending: ``The retired values `alert_rule` and `monitoring` are rejected with `410 Gone`.``

`monitors.mdx`: line 35 → `**Service stopped**, **Process stopped** and **Process resource** monitors are delivered to the agent directly from the policy's attached monitors; the per-policy *Check interval* on the Monitors tab sets how often the agent evaluates them.`; §"Converting a legacy alert rule" (104-118) → a short "Legacy rules" section: conversion happened in the previous release; anything that could not convert is listed once on **Alerts → Monitors** with its reason; open alerts from those rules stay open until resolved; the legacy write endpoints, including `POST /alerts/rules/:id/test`, return `410 Gone`; test monitors with `POST /monitor-definitions/:id/test`. Revert for these legacy sources ended at the W05d upgrade (Task 6); delete the API row at 157 if W05c2 removed `convert-from-rule` (grep the routes) or reword it as retired; troubleshooting 169-173 → replace with "**The Monitors page shows *N legacy rules could not be converted*.** Open the list; each row names the policy and the reason. Recreate the condition as a monitor (Composite for multi-condition rules), then dismiss the banner."

`alerts.mdx`: "Creating Alert Rules" (116-160), "Testing a Rule" (162), "Partner-wide Rules" (168) and "Offline Duration for Configuration Policy Rules" (240) → one section **Alert conditions are monitors** pointing at `/features/monitors/`, keeping the severity/status/response/correlation/notification sections. Update the intro sentence at line 10 ("triggered by **rules** you define" → "raised by **monitors** you define").

`docs/release-notes/next-release-draft.md` — under **Self-Hosting / Upgrade Notes**:
```md
- **Legacy alerting retired (alerting consolidation W05d).** The policy **Alerts** and **Service & Process Monitoring** tabs, the `/alerts/rules` page and `POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /alerts/rules*` and `/alert-templates*` are gone (`410 Gone`; reads remain for history). On first boot the API converts whatever the previous release's *Convert everything* left unconverted, per partner, and retires what cannot convert with a reason; **Alerts → Monitors** shows a one-time banner listing those rows. Open alerts raised by a retired rule stay open until someone resolves them. Standalone alert rules nobody converted now route through Delivery routing rows instead of their own channel list. Every boot then counts unretired `config_policy_alert_rules` / `config_policy_monitoring_watches`; a non-zero count is logged at error level and reported to Sentry (nothing evaluates those rows any more) — the banner tells you what to do. `BREEZE_LEGACY_ALERTING_SWEEP=false` skips the conversion (the count still runs). Run the previous release's *Convert everything* before upgrading if you want to preview each conversion; this release does it unattended.
- **Migration `2026-10-24-100000-legacy-alerting-retirement-sweep.sql`** re-keys each policy's check interval to its `monitors` feature link and prints `RAISE WARNING` counts of anything still unretired. Idempotent; no data is deleted.
```
`CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`: under **Removed** — the tabs, page, endpoints, `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy`, the `alert_rule`/`monitoring` feature types (`RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES`), `manage_alert_rules.list_templates`, `scripts/migrateToConfigPolicies.ts`; under **Changed** — check interval on the `monitors` link; boot sweep + count check; delivery for unconverted standalone rules; under **Critical for self-hosters upgrading to this release** — the two bullets above condensed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS.**
```bash
cd apps/docs && pnpm build
grep -rn "Service & Process Monitoring tab\|/features/service-monitoring\|/alerts/rules\|POST /alerts/rules\|Alerts tab\|alert_rule\b" apps/docs/src/content/docs --include='*.mdx' | grep -v "retired\|no longer"   # no output
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**
```bash
git add apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/alerts.mdx apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/configuration-policies.mdx apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/monitors.mdx docs/release-notes/next-release-draft.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: alerting consolidation W05d — removals, boot check, self-hoster notes and Revert deadline"
```

### Task 15: Verification pass (end of PR1 and again at end of PR2)

**Files:** none created. Read-only checks against the whole tree.

- [ ] **Step 1: Migration naming and RLS scope.**
```bash
git fetch origin && git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main apps/api/migrations | grep -E '^apps/api/migrations/[0-9]{4}-[^/]+\.sql$' | sort | tail -1     # must sort BEFORE 2026-10-24-100000-…
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts src/config/composeBindMounts.test.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Typecheck every package touched.**
```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/shared exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @breeze/api exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @breeze/web exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @breeze/web build
cd apps/docs && pnpm build          # PR2 only
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Full API unit suite and touched shared/web suites (each PR).**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/constants src/validators
cd apps/api && npx vitest run
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/configurationPolicies src/components/devices/DeviceEffectiveConfigTab src/components/alerts src/components/monitoring src/lib/__tests__ src/locales
```
Check the reported file counts against the File Structure table — vitest's filter is a substring match; a typo silently runs zero files.

- [ ] **Step 4: Integration suites (live stack).** Any integration test that seeds a notification channel and expects delivery must also seed a matching routing row or an Everything else row; there is no channel fallback (D27). Touches migrations, the agent config builder and system-context writes, so all of these run (including the scoped retirement report and last-detachment/revert regressions):
```bash
pnpm test-stack up
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.integration.config.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementMigration.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/legacyAlertingRetirementSweep.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/monitorWatchDelivery.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/agentPolicyResolversPartnerWide.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/orgLifecycleFoundations.integration.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run -c vitest.config.rls.ts
pnpm test-stack down
```
`rls-coverage`, `tenantCascade`, both export-policy suites and the org-lifecycle merge contract must be green *unchanged* — this wave adds no table, column, policy or list entry; a red there means a stray schema change slipped in.

- [ ] **Step 5: Grep contracts (PR2).** First verify the converter still has its private baseline and the lifecycle helper, while public delivery has no legacy branch:
```bash
test -f apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyBaseline.ts
test -f apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/legacyDeliveryBaseline.ts
rg -n 'resolveLegacyBaseline|resolveLegacyDeliveryBaseline' apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion/equivalence.ts
rg -n 'isRevertAvailable' apps/api/src/services/monitors/conversion
```
Then each obsolete-production-symbol check must print nothing (negative regression tests may still name removed symbols):
```bash
rg -n "evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy|getApplicableRulesFromPolicy|checkAutoResolveFromConfigPolicy|isConfigPolicyRuleCooling|markConfigPolicyRuleCooldown|resolveAlertRulesForDevice|resolveGoverningAlertRulePolicyForDevice" apps/api/src --glob '!*.test.ts'
rg -n "legacyOverride|legacy_override|legacyEscalation" apps/api/src/services/delivery apps/api/src/services/notificationDispatcher.ts apps/web/src/components/alerts/delivery/DeliveryPreview.tsx --glob '!*.test.ts'
grep -rn "AlertRuleTab\|MonitoringTab\|LegacyRulesPage\|AlertRuleForm\|AlertRuleTestModal" apps/web/src
grep -rn "'alert_rule'\|'monitoring'" apps/api/src/services/configurationPolicy.ts apps/api/src/routes/configurationPolicies apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFleet.ts | grep -v "RETIRED\|retired"
grep -rn "list_templates\|migrateToConfigPolicies" apps/api/src packages/shared/src
grep -rn "alertRuleTab\|monitoringTab\|alertsRules" apps/web/src/locales
```
And one that must print exactly the retired list: `grep -n "RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES = " packages/shared/src/constants/configFeatureTypes.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Boot smoke (PR2).** Bring up the worktree stack (`pnpm wt-stack up`), watch the API log for `[startup] Legacy alerting retirement: … unretired rules=0 watches=0`, `GET /api/v1/monitor-definitions/conversion/pending?orgId=<seed org>` returns scoped `unconvertible` rows (partner-wide view returns the sweep marker), `POST /api/v1/alerts/rules` returns 410, `/alerts/rules` redirects to `/alerts/monitors`, and `/configuration-policies/<id>#alert_rule` lands on `#monitors` with the hash rewritten. Then seed one unretired `config_policy_alert_rules` row by hand (`retired_at = NULL`) with `BREEZE_LEGACY_ALERTING_SWEEP=false`, restart the API, and confirm the error log line and the Sentry capture (`[legacy-alerting-retirement] Legacy alerting rows are still unretired …`) — that is the only proof the loud path is wired. `pnpm wt-stack down` afterwards; say what you left running.

- [ ] **Step 7: PR hygiene.** PR1 title `feat(alerting): W05d part 1 — retirement sweep, settings re-key, boot check and Revert guard`; PR2 title `feat(alerting): W05d part 2 — retire legacy alerting surfaces (410s, tabs, evaluator, docs)` with `Closes #<W05d sub-issue>`. Both bodies state: ordering assumption (W05c shipped in a prior release), the migration name check result, the sweep/boot-check design (TypeScript after `serve()`, mirrors built-in monitors), the two-table count, the equivalence-refusal → retire decision, the nullable system actor, the retained private baseline, the W05d Revert deadline and guard in PR1, and that no cascade/export/RLS list changed. Run `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` once per PR; act only on confirmed findings.

**Open questions:** None. D19 settles equivalence refusal, the legacy test endpoint's 410, and leaving non-terminal alerts for manual resolution. These decisions are implemented in Tasks 4, 9, 11 and 14.
