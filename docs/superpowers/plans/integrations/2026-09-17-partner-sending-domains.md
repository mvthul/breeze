# Partner sending domains — Plan Index

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-design.md`
(approved by Todd 2026-09-17 as written; D1–D7 resolved per the §12
recommendations). The amendments below are applied by these plans.

One plan document per wave. Each wave is one PR on its own branch
`feature/6180-partner-sending-domains/wave-<sub-issue#>` with
`Closes #<sub-issue#>` in the PR body. State lives on GitHub
(feature-lifecycle); the wave issue is the source of truth for status, never
this index. `get_feature_status` before starting any wave.

| Wave | Plan | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| W01 (#6181) | [Sender contract: `MAIL_PURPOSES` registry, required `purpose` on `sendEmail`, raw `from` removed, every send site classified, `resolveSender` (platform lane only), `deliverRaw`, golden test](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w01-sender-contract.md) | — |
| W02 (#6182) | [Foundation A: migration (three tables, RLS, release guard), Drizzle schema, allowlist registrations, shared validators, env + boot validation, `EmailDomainProvider` with `resend` / `static` / `fake` adapters, `custom_sending_domain` capability, provider-release hooks in `cascadeDeletePartner` / `finalizePartnerOffboarding`](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w02-data-model-and-adapters.md) | W01 (`deliverRaw`) |
| W03 (#6183) | [Foundation B: domain service, `sending-domains` worker and cadence, partner and admin routes, outbox drain, audit, status-transition mail, drift report](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w03-service-worker-routes.md) | W02 |
| W04 (#6184) | [Partner lane: partner branch of `resolveSender`, partner-lane send with fallback semantics, daily cap, `X-Breeze-Outbound` and loop prevention](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w04-partner-lane.md) | W01, W03 |
| W05 (#6185) | [Web UI and docs: settings tab (DNS and `static` variants), identities, test send, i18n, E2E, `apps/docs` page, self-hosting guide](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w05-web-ui-and-docs.md) | W03 (UI), W04 (end-to-end) |
| W06 (#6186) | [Feedback and abuse: delivery webhooks, daily stats, automatic suspension, abuse signals, evidence-card entry, admin metrics](2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w06-delivery-feedback-and-abuse.md) | W04 |

W01 → W02 → W03 → W04 are serial. W05 may start once W03 has merged (its
E2E needs W04). W06 starts after W04. Hosted stays dark (provider unset) through
W04; W05 enables allow-listed partners; W06 is the hosted GA gate (spec §15, §16).

## Spec amendments these plans apply

1. **The spec's single Foundation wave is split into W02 and W03**, and the
   waves are renumbered W01–W06 (the spec's §15 table has been updated to
   match). The original Foundation wave (three tables + RLS + three adapters +
   worker + two route files + cascade hooks) is too large for one review round
   on a tenancy surface. W02 is data model, config and adapters; W03 is
   everything that calls them. Both land dark. The release hooks ship in W02
   with the `BEFORE DELETE` guard, so the guard never exists without the path
   that satisfies it.
2. **W01 and W02 are not parallel.** The spec's first draft called them file-disjoint,
   but the `static` and `fake` adapters and the `test-send` job hand a message
   with a custom From to the platform transport, and W01 removes `from` from
   `SendEmailParams`. W01 therefore adds the one sanctioned raw entry point,
   `EmailService.deliverRaw`, and W02 consumes it. Serial order, no rebase
   hazard.
3. **`PartnerLaneSendError` is carried by a class.** The spec types the error as
   a union and says `send` "throws" it. Adapters throw
   `PartnerLaneSendFailure extends Error` whose `.error` is the spec's union.
4. **`partnerName` travels with the send.** The `partner_display_name` fallback
   (`"<Partner> via Breeze" <EMAIL_FROM>`) needs the partner's name, and W01
   must not add a database read. The two call sites already hold the name and
   pass it; see `SendEmailParams` below.
5. **`sending_domain.test` is a tag value, not a registry entry.** The test send
   bypasses `sendEmail` (§6.1), and the registry asserts every purpose has a
   send site. `staff.sending_domain_status` is added to the registry by W03,
   together with its send site.
6. **Existing behaviour pinned, not fixed:** the Mailgun branch of `sendEmail`
   drops `cc` today (`services/email.ts:275-284`). W01's golden test records
   that as-is; fixing it is a separate issue, not part of a byte-identical wave.

7. **Spec §8.2 misses one send site**, `routes/auth/verifyEmail.ts` →
   `sendEmailChanged` (`auth.email_changed`, platform). And its two
   `ticketNotifyWorker` rows are one `sendEmail` call; W01 makes the worker's
   `EmailPayload` a discriminated union carrying the purpose.
8. **Two partner-lane sites have no partner id in hand** (`routes/portal/auth.ts`
   portal password reset; `services/reportDelivery.ts` `emailReportRun`). W01
   passes `null` (no new reads in a byte-identical wave); **W04 widens both**, or
   portal resets and the whole `general` stream could never use a partner domain.
9. **Spec §3.5's "no other list applies" is wrong.** Two more contracts fire:
   `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` in
   `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` (every
   `src/services/**` / `src/routes/**` file that mutates a partner-axis table;
   `src/jobs/**` is not scanned), and `config/envComposeParity.test.ts` (each
   `.env.example` must match its paired compose file, so the root
   `docker-compose.yml` is mapped too). Both run in the required **Test API** job.
10. **Env vars are declared in the zod schema in `config/validate.ts`**, not
    `config/env.ts` (spec §11), as optional strings — compose maps an unset var
    as `""`, so a bare `z.enum` would refuse boot on upgrade.
11. **Interface deltas forced by `static`:** `createDomain` input gains
    `partnerSlug?: string | null` (the allow-list binds by slug); `static`'s
    `getDomain` keys on the domain name and never returns `verified`, so
    `syncSendingDomain` treats `pending` from a `verifiesByDns = false` adapter
    as "no change" and the test-send job calls `markStaticDomainVerified`.
12. **Worker registration needs a readiness rule and a schedule slot:**
    `'sending_domains_configured'` in `jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts` (else
    `/ready` pins false when the provider is unset) and
    `'sending-domains-daily': '3 21 * * *'` in `jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts` (a bare
    24 h `every` fails the schedule contract test and stampedes at 00:00 UTC).
13. **Partner write routes also carry `canManagePartnerWidePolicies`**, as
    `PATCH /partners/me` (the stack §7 names) does inline.
14. **Structured transport errors land in W04.** `deliverRaw` inherits today's
    opaque throws, so W02's `static` send-error classifier is text-based; W04
    adds `EmailTransportError` (message preserved) and upgrades the classifier.

## Migration slots reserved

Newest committed migration on `origin/main` (`5104a31e7`, 2026-09-17) is
`2026-10-17-140000-snmp-metrics-instance-width.sql`. Open plan branches hold
slots through `2026-10-19-100100`. These plans take the `2026-10-20-10` block.

| File | Wave |
|---|---|
| `2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql` | W02 |
| `2026-10-20-130000-partner-sending-daily-stats.sql` | W06 |

Every executor re-checks `ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1` before
committing and renames upward if main has moved past these names. W01, W03,
W04 and W05 need no migration.

## Cross-wave names that must not drift

Later waves consume these verbatim. A wave that needs a different shape changes
this index in the same PR.

## Rules every wave inherits

- Rigor is **high** for W02, W03, W04 and W06 (tenancy, partner cascade, send
  path, public webhook): red first on every task, contract suites
  (`vitest.config.rls.ts`, `vitest.integration.config.ts`) before the PR, one
  independent review round. W01 and W05 are wide but low-risk: red first,
  typecheck, affected tests.
- Test commands: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>` (never
  `pnpm --filter … test -- --run`); integration suites need
  `pnpm test-stack up` and are torn down with `pnpm test-stack down`.
- Partner-axis tables return zero rows to org-scoped and portal contexts. Any
  read from those contexts goes through `readWithPartnerAxisVisibility`
  (`apps/api/src/db/partnerAxisRead.ts`) and is proven by an integration test
  on real Postgres; a mocked DB cannot see the zero-row failure.
- No route handler calls the provider. Routes write intent rows; the worker
  calls out.
- Never delete a provider domain with `provider_managed = false`.
- No new env var is ever required by an upgrade; `requireIf` is keyed on
  `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER`, never on `EMAIL_PROVIDER`.
- Every UI wave ends with an explicit mount task naming the page; every route
  wave has a task that registers the route in `apps/api/src/index.ts` and a
  test that reaches it through the app.
- Commit after every task with the trailer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Deferred (roadmap, recorded when the feature is registered)

SES adapter with per-partner SES tenants and the regional cutover; Breeze-issued
TXT ownership challenge before provider create (D6 alternative); a `staff`
stream for alert and staff mail (D5); plan gating of custom domains (D1);
branded inbound domains (Model B) and its mirror cross-partner check (§3.4); a
Mailgun domain-API adapter; a resolver cache; extending the
`"<Partner> via Breeze"` display name to more purposes on hosted; dropping the
system-context escape in `resolveSender` once #2822 lands a read-only
partner-axis RLS branch; Mailgun `cc` being dropped by `sendEmail`.
