# Partner Sending Domains W03: Service, Worker and Routes — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Everything that *calls* W02's data model and adapters: the `sendingDomainService` (list / create / check / remove / identities / admin suspend-unsuspend-force-release / capability), the `syncSendingDomain` state machine with its cadence, the `sending-domains` BullMQ worker (sweep, outbox drain, test send, daily maintenance, key probe), the `staff.sending_domain_status` transactional mail, and the two route files (`/partner/sending-domains`, `/admin/sending-domains`). It lands **dark**: `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` is unset, so `getEmailDomainProvider()` returns `null`, every route answers `404 sending_domains_unsupported`, and the worker is not registered.

**Architecture:** Request handlers only write intent rows and enqueue; the worker owns every provider call (spec §2). `syncSendingDomain` advances one row one step per job, idempotently, in **three phases with explicit DB-context boundaries** (short system transaction → provider call with NO context held → short system transaction), the `ticketOutboxPublisher.ts` shape. Provisioning commits `provision_attempted_at` in phase 1 *before* the provider `createDomain` in phase 2, so a crash between them is classified as "ours" on retry (spec §5.1 case 3) instead of adopted as pre-existing. `removing` deletes at the provider **only when `provider_managed`**, then nulls `provider_domain_id`, then deletes the row — in that order, because W02's `BEFORE DELETE` guard raises while `provider_domain_id IS NOT NULL`. Creates avoid the 23505-aborts-the-request-transaction trap entirely by using `onConflictDoNothing({ target: … }).returning()` and treating a missing row as the conflict (the repo's preferred idiom, `routes/partnerServicePrincipals.ts:277-279`).

**Tech Stack:** Hono + Zod (`lib/validation`'s `zValidator`), Drizzle, BullMQ on the shared ioredis connection (`services/redis.ts`'s `getBullMQConnection()`), Redis sliding-window limiter (`services/rate-limit.ts`), Vitest (unit + one real-Postgres integration extension).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-design.md` §2 (one-worker rule), §3.1–§3.3 (columns), §4.3 (`409 domain_unavailable`), §4.4 (identity rules), §5.1–§5.2 (adapter classification, status map), §6.1–§6.4 (jobs, cadence, transitions, drift), §7 (API), §9.1 (kill switch, caps, audit), §13 (error table), §14 (testing). Index: `docs/superpowers/plans/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains.md` — amendment 1 (W02 split), amendment 5 (`staff.sending_domain_status` is added here with its send site).

---

## Plan amendments

Recorded here because the spec or the index does not pin them and the real code forced the choice. Each one is also listed in the reply that accompanied this plan.

1. **The provider key probe crosses a process boundary, so it lives in Redis, not a module variable.** Spec §5.1 says the worker probes `listDomains()` once on start and a permission error sets the capability to `supported: false, reason: 'provider_key_send_only'`. In production `BREEZE_ROLE=worker` and `BREEZE_ROLE=api` are **separate processes** (`worker.ts` vs `index.ts`), so a flag set in the worker's module scope is invisible to the route that renders the capability. The worker writes the probe verdict to the Redis key `emaildomains:key-probe:v1` with a 25 h TTL (re-written on every boot and by the daily maintenance job); `getSendingDomainsCapability` reads it. A missing/unreadable key means "not probed" and never blocks — the capability then reports no `provider_key_send_only` reason. Routes still make **zero** provider calls.
2. **The daily job is a cron slot, never `repeat: { every: 24h }`, and it carries BOTH the hosted drift report and the `static` re-check.** BullMQ anchors `every` to the Unix epoch, so every 24 h repeatable fires at 00:00:00.000 UTC — `jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts:1-63` documents the resulting production pile-up, and `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` ("registers no repeatable job with an hour-or-coarser `every` interval", `:490`) fails the build for one. This wave allocates one new slot, `'sending-domains-daily': '3 21 * * *'` (hour 21 is unused in the daily ≡ 3 mod 5 lane), and one `daily-maintenance` job that runs the drift report when `isHosted()` and the `static` delist re-check when `provider.verifiesByDns === false`. The same job is also enqueued once, un-repeated, at worker boot — that is what satisfies spec §6.1's "re-run on worker start and daily".
3. **Registering the worker only when configured needs a new readiness rule, not just an early `return`.** `jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts` declares each registry entry's consumers and requires them; a plain `consumers('sendingDomainsWorker')` row would `expect(name, true)` on a default (unconfigured) deployment while `initializeSendingDomainsWorker()` returns before constructing a Worker, pinning `/ready` false forever — exactly the hazard `workerReadinessManifest.ts:60-64` records for `aiAgentRunner`. This wave adds the `'sending_domains_configured'` `ConsumerRequirementRule`, its `ruleEnabled` case, the `sendingDomainsConfigured` field on `declareExpectedConsumers`'s input, both call sites (`index.ts:1170`, `worker.ts:595`) and the rule mirror in `workerReadinessManifest.test.ts`.
4. **`createSendingDomain` never raises 23505.** The repo's trap (`utils/pgErrors.ts:42-57`, prod incident 2026-09-15) is that a unique violation raised on the request's own `withDbAccessContext` transaction aborts it even when caught, so the mapped 409 surfaces as a 500 at commit. `partner_sending_domains` has a plain `UNIQUE (domain)`, so the sanctioned form applies directly: `onConflictDoNothing({ target: partnerSendingDomains.domain }).returning()` and `if (!created) → 409 domain_unavailable`. No savepoint, no catch, nothing raised. (The savepoint form, `db.transaction` + `isPgUniqueViolation(err, name)`, is only needed for partial/expression indexes — it is not needed here.)
5. **The cross-partner `partner_inbound_domains` check (§3.4) must go through `readWithPartnerAxisVisibility`.** `partner_inbound_domains` is partner-axis, so a partner-scoped RLS context reading it by domain sees **zero rows** for another partner's row and the check would silently pass. `db/partnerAxisRead.ts`'s escape is the sanctioned read for exactly this. The lookup key is the requested domain (already normalised); no partner id from request input is ever used as an axis.
6. **The admin routes mount on the admin hub, not on `apps/api/src/index.ts`.** `routes/admin/index.ts:13-15` already applies `platformAdminMiddleware` to everything it mounts (`adminRoutes` itself is mounted at `index.ts:1084`). Only `partnerSendingDomainsRoutes` is added to `index.ts`, and it must be registered **before** `api.route('/partner', partnerRoutes)` at `index.ts:1004`, the same ordering constraint `/partner/trust` observes.
7. **The test send is capped by the route limit alone in this wave.** Spec §6.1 says the test send counts against the daily partner-lane cap, but `tryCountPartnerLaneSend` is defined in W04 (index, "Defined in W04"). In W03 the only bound is the route's 5/h/partner limit; W04 adds the cap call to the `test-send` processor.
8. **The "Partner Admin" recipient query is implemented locally, not extracted.** No `getPartnerAdminEmails` helper exists; the `partnerUsers → users → roles` join on `roles.name = 'Partner Admin'` is duplicated today in `routes/auth/accountDeletion.ts:62-98` and `services/tenantOffboarding.ts:1767-1783`. W03 writes a third copy inside `services/emailDomains/statusMail.ts` with a comment naming the other two, rather than refactoring two unrelated files in a tenancy-surface PR.
9. **The status-mail template lives in `statusMail.ts`, not in `services/email.ts`.** It is written in the `buildQuoteOutcomeTemplate` idiom (`renderLayout` + `BODY_PARA`/`MUTED_PARA` + a hand-built text arm returning `EmailTemplate`) but placed beside its send site, the precedent `services/quoteEmail.ts:2` already sets by importing `supportFooter, BODY_PARA, MUTED_PARA, type EmailTemplate` back from `./email`. `email.ts` is 1295 lines; this keeps it from growing.

### Added when W02's finished plan was reconciled against this one

10. **A sixth registration list: `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`.** `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts:64` derives the partner-axis table set from the **live Drizzle schema** (`partnerAxisTableNames()`: any table with `partnerId` and no `notNull` `orgId`), so `partnerSendingDomains` and `partnerSenderIdentities` join it the moment W02's Task 1 lands. It then greps every `.ts` under `src/routes/**` and `src/services/**` (`collectSourceFiles()`, `:290-291`) for `\.(insert|update|delete)\(\s*<table>\s*[,)]` and fails the required **Test API** job unless the file mentions `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` or is allowlisted with a reason of ≥ 20 characters. **Verified: `src/jobs/**` is NOT scanned**, so `jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.ts` needs no entry even though it updates `partnerSendingDomains`. Two W03 files do: `services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.ts` (Task 6) and `services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts` (Task 3). Each task registers its own file so every task is green standing alone — the test's "no stale entries" case (`:354`) additionally means an entry may not be added before the file mutates the table. W02 registers `services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts` the same way (its amendment 3); the routes are not flagged because they mutate nothing directly.
11. **The write routes gain a `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` gate.** Not merely to satisfy amendment 10 — on the merits. A sending domain and a sender identity are partner-wide by construction: the From address applies to every org under the MSP, including orgs created later, which is exactly what epic #2135's rule protects and what `partnerServicePrincipals.ts` was fixed for in the 2026-08-16 review. `PATCH /partners/me`, which spec §7 names as the model stack, carries this gate inline (`routes/orgs.ts:911-916`) — the spec's summary of that stack simply omitted it. So an `orgAccess: 'selected'` partner user cannot add, re-point or remove the MSP's sending identity. The two service files stay allowlisted, with reasons pointing at this gate.
12. **`normalizeSendingDomain` returns a discriminated union, not `string | null`.** W02 Task 3 pins `NormalizeSendingDomainResult = { ok: true; domain } | { ok: false; reason: SendingDomainRejection }`. `createSendingDomain` therefore checks `result.ok` and surfaces `reason` in the 400 body, which is strictly better than the `null` this plan first assumed: the UI can say *why* the domain was refused. Identity validation likewise uses W02's `senderLocalPartSchema` / `senderDisplayNameSchema` / `RESERVED_SENDER_LOCAL_PARTS` instead of the regex this plan originally hand-rolled — one definition, shared with the web.
13. **A `pending` result from a non-DNS adapter is "no change", and provisioning must carry the partner slug.** Both are W02 contracts (its amendments 4 and 5). `static.getDomain(key)` keys on the **domain name** (there is no provider id) and *never* returns `verified` — only an accepted test send moves a `static` row there — so `syncSendingDomain` acts on `failed` alone when `provider.verifiesByDns === false`, or every daily re-check would demote a verified `static` domain back to `pending`. And `createDomain` takes `partnerSlug`, because `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED` binds entries by slug (`domain:partner-slug`), so the provisioning phase loads the partner's `slug` alongside the domain row and passes it.
14. **The drift report resolves `createdAt` with `findDomainByName`, not from `listDomains()`.** W02 pins `listDomains(): Promise<Array<{ providerDomainId; domain }>>` — no creation time. Spec §6.4 only alerts on a provider domain **older than 24 h**, so the report fetches `findDomainByName(domain)` for each *unknown* domain (rare by construction: a leak, not a routine row) and treats a missing `createdAt` as reportable rather than suppressing it. Error classification during provisioning likewise keys on W02's `ProviderDomainConflictError` / `ProviderDomainRejectedError` classes, not on an ad-hoc `err.reason` property.

## Consumed from W02 (reconciled against its finished plan)

W02's plan is complete (`docs/superpowers/plans/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-w02-data-model-and-adapters.md`). Every name below was read from its Interfaces blocks and is binding — this wave does not guess any of them. Where W02's shape differs from the plan index's "Defined in W02" list, W02 wins and the difference is called out.

From W01: `EmailService.deliverRaw(message: RawEmailMessage): Promise<void>`, `MAIL_PURPOSES` / `MailPurpose` / `PartnerMailStream` in `services/emailDomains/mailPurposes.ts`, `sendEmail({ …, purpose })`.

### Still unpinned — reconcile before merging W03

- **`releaseSendingDomainsForPartner`'s outbox `reason`.** W02's tests write `'partner_released'` for both hooks. W03 never calls that function, so nothing here depends on it; noted only so the CHECK's fourth value (`'force_release'`, which W03's admin force-release writes) is not mistaken for dead.
- **Whether `EmailService.sendEmail` accepts `to: string[]`.** Today's `SendEmailParams.to` is `string | string[]` (`services/email.ts:18`) and W01 keeps `SendEmailBase` as "today's fields minus `from`", so `statusMail.ts` passes an array. If W01 narrows it, `statusMail.ts` joins with `', '` instead.
- **`SendingDomainDto.lastTestStatus` has no `'passed'` value.** W03 writes `'sent'` on success and `'failed'` on a refusal; `'pending'` is unused by this wave (it exists for a queued test the UI can show in W05).

## Names this wave introduces beyond the index

- `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.ts` — `buildSendingDomainStatusTemplate`, `sendSendingDomainStatusEmail`, `type SendingDomainStatusEvent`.
- `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/keyProbe.ts` — `recordProviderKeyProbe`, `readProviderKeyProbe`.
- `'sending-domains-daily'` in `JOB_SCHEDULES` (`jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts`).
- `'sending_domains_configured'` in `ConsumerRequirementRule` (`jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts`).

---

## Global Constraints

Binding for every task in this plan. Do not relax any of them without changing the plan index in the same PR.

- **No route handler calls the provider.** Routes write intent rows and enqueue jobs. Task 9 adds a source-scan test asserting neither route file imports `providerRegistry` or any adapter, in both the static and the dynamic import form.
- **All provider management calls happen in the one `sending-domains` worker** (spec §2). `getEmailDomainProvider()` is imported by `domainSync.ts`, `sendingDomainsWorker.ts` and nothing else in this wave.
- **Never delete a provider domain with `provider_managed = false`** (spec §5.1, §14). Removal, partner release and failed-row expiry all drop the local row only; `deleteDomain` is never called and no `email_provider_domain_releases` row is written. Task 3's tests assert this on all three paths.
- **Delete order on `removing` is fixed**: `deleteDomain` (managed only) → `UPDATE … SET provider_domain_id = NULL` → `DELETE` the row. W02's `BEFORE DELETE` trigger raises while `provider_domain_id IS NOT NULL`, so reordering fails loudly.
- **Register every partner-axis write file in `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`** (`apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`) in the SAME task that makes it mutate the table, and put the real gate (`canManagePartnerWidePolicies`) on the caller-facing routes. `src/routes/**` and `src/services/**` are scanned; `src/jobs/**` is not.
- **A `pending` result from an adapter with `verifiesByDns === false` is NO CHANGE.** Only `failed` acts. A `static` row reaches `verified` through `markStaticDomainVerified`, called by the `test-send` job after the relay accepted the message — never through a poll.
- **The worker registers only when a provider is configured** — the `initializeAbuseSignalsWorker` enable-check shape (`jobs/abuseSignalsSweep.ts:149-188`), plus the readiness rule of plan amendment 3.
- **Provider calls never run while a pooled DB connection is held** (#1105). Every provider/Redis/SMTP round trip sits *between* short `withSystemDbAccessContext` phases, never inside one — `jobs/ticketOutboxPublisher.ts:130-260` is the reference shape.
- **Rigor is high** (tenancy, partner cascade, abuse surface). Red first on every task: write the failing test, run it, watch it fail for the stated reason, then implement. Before the PR run the contract suites against a real database: `pnpm test-stack up`, then the integration and RLS runs of Task 11, then `pnpm test-stack down`.
- Branch `feature/6180-partner-sending-domains/wave-6183`; PR body contains `Closes #6183`. `get_feature_status` before starting.
- Test command form is `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`. Never `pnpm --filter … test -- --run <path>` (the `--` is forwarded into argv and vitest runs the whole suite in watch mode).
- Commit after every task with the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

### Task 1: Cadence — `nextCheckDelayMs`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SendingDomainStatus` from `./provider` (W02).
- Produces: `export function nextCheckDelayMs(status: SendingDomainStatus, checkAttempts: number, rng?: () => number): number`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { nextCheckDelayMs } from './domainSync';

const MIN = 60_000;

describe('nextCheckDelayMs (spec §6.2)', () => {
  it('polls a pending domain every 2 minutes for the first five attempts', () => {
    for (const attempts of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) {
      expect(nextCheckDelayMs('pending', attempts)).toBe(2 * MIN);
    }
  });

  it('slows a pending domain to 10 minutes for the next six attempts', () => {
    for (const attempts of [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) {
      expect(nextCheckDelayMs('pending', attempts)).toBe(10 * MIN);
    }
  });

  it('settles a pending domain at hourly until the provider fails it', () => {
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('pending', 11)).toBe(60 * MIN);
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('pending', 400)).toBe(60 * MIN);
  });

  it('polls at_risk hourly, whatever the attempt count', () => {
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('at_risk', 0)).toBe(60 * MIN);
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('at_risk', 99)).toBe(60 * MIN);
  });

  it('polls failed hourly so the 72h expiry sweep can fire', () => {
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('failed', 0)).toBe(60 * MIN);
  });

  it('re-checks a verified domain daily with at most +/-10% jitter', () => {
    const day = 24 * 60 * MIN;
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('verified', 0, () => 0)).toBe(Math.round(day * 0.9));
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('verified', 0, () => 1)).toBe(Math.round(day * 1.1));
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('verified', 0, () => 0.5)).toBe(day);
  });

  it('spreads verified rows rather than stacking them on one instant', () => {
    const values = new Set([0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.65, 0.85].map((r) => nextCheckDelayMs('verified', 0, () => r)));
    expect(values.size).toBe(5);
  });

  it('retries provisioning and removing quickly, and parks suspended for a day', () => {
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('provisioning', 0)).toBe(MIN);
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('removing', 0)).toBe(MIN);
    expect(nextCheckDelayMs('suspended', 0)).toBe(24 * 60 * MIN);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts`
Expected: the whole file fails to collect — `Failed to resolve import "./domainSync"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts`:

```ts
import type { SendingDomainStatus } from './provider';

const MINUTE_MS = 60_000;
const HOUR_MS = 60 * MINUTE_MS;
const DAY_MS = 24 * HOUR_MS;

/** Attempts served at the 2-minute cadence before stepping down (spec §6.2). */
const PENDING_FAST_ATTEMPTS = 5;
/** Attempts served at the 10-minute cadence after that, before going hourly. */
const PENDING_MEDIUM_ATTEMPTS = 6;

/**
 * Row-level poll cadence (spec §6.2). Returned as a DELAY, not an absolute
 * time, so the caller owns `now` and every test can pin it.
 *
 *   pending   2 min x5, then 10 min x6, then hourly until the provider fails it
 *   at_risk   hourly (the provider's own 72 h grace is what ends this state)
 *   verified  every 24 h +/- 10% jitter, PER ROW
 *   failed    hourly, purely so the 72 h `failed_expired` check runs
 *
 * The jitter is the whole reason `verified` is not a daily cron: without it
 * every row verified in the same tick re-checks in the same minute forever,
 * and the fleet re-converges. Same helper shape as
 * `services/m365Sync/cadence.ts`'s `nextSyncAt` — `rng` exists only so a test
 * can pin it.
 */
export function nextCheckDelayMs(
  status: SendingDomainStatus,
  checkAttempts: number,
  rng: () => number = Math.random,
): number {
  switch (status) {
    case 'provisioning':
    case 'removing':
      // Both are "the worker still owes this row an external call". The job's
      // own BullMQ retry is the primary recovery; this is the sweep's backstop.
      return MINUTE_MS;
    case 'pending': {
      const attempts = Math.max(0, Math.trunc(checkAttempts));
      if (attempts < PENDING_FAST_ATTEMPTS) return 2 * MINUTE_MS;
      if (attempts < PENDING_FAST_ATTEMPTS + PENDING_MEDIUM_ATTEMPTS) return 10 * MINUTE_MS;
      return HOUR_MS;
    }
    case 'at_risk':
    case 'failed':
      return HOUR_MS;
    case 'verified': {
      const jitter = 0.9 + rng() * 0.2;
      return Math.round(DAY_MS * jitter);
    }
    case 'suspended':
      // No provider calls at all (spec §6.1); the row is only revisited so an
      // unsuspend that raced the sweep is not stuck behind a stale next_check_at.
      return DAY_MS;
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it green**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts`
Expected: 8 passed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): sending-domain poll cadence with per-row jitter (spec 6.2)

### Task 2: Status mail — registry entry, template, send site

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/mailPurposes.ts` — add one key to the `MAIL_PURPOSES` object literal, in the `staff.*` block immediately after `'staff.quote_outcome'` (the file is created by W01; the block mirrors spec §8.2 row 6)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getEmailService()` and `BODY_PARA` / `MUTED_PARA` / `supportFooter` / `EmailTemplate` from `../email`; `renderLayout`, `escapeHtml` from `../emailLayout`; `MAIL_PURPOSES` from `./mailPurposes`.
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type SendingDomainStatusEvent = 'verified' | 'at_risk' | 'failed' | 'suspended' | 'auto_removed';
  export interface SendingDomainStatusMailInput {
    partnerId: string; domain: string; event: SendingDomainStatusEvent;

  }
  export function buildSendingDomainStatusTemplate(input: SendingDomainStatusMailInput): EmailTemplate;
  export async function sendSendingDomainStatusEmail(input: SendingDomainStatusMailInput): Promise<number>;
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.test.ts`:

```ts

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the registry entry**

In `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/mailPurposes.ts`, inside the `MAIL_PURPOSES` object literal, immediately after the `'staff.quote_outcome'` entry, add:

```ts
  // W03. The notice that a partner's own sending domain is verified / at risk
  // / failed / suspended / auto-removed. PLATFORM on purpose: a mail saying
  // "your sending domain is broken" must never be sent from that domain

Create `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.ts`:

### Task 3: The `syncSendingDomain` state machine

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts` — append below `nextCheckDelayMs` (the file's only export after Task 1)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts` — append a second `describe` block below the cadence block
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` — one `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` entry (see Step 0; this file starts mutating `partnerSendingDomains` in this task, and the required **Test API** job reds without it)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getEmailDomainProvider()` (`./providerRegistry`), `EmailDomainProvider` / `ProviderDomain` / `SendingDomainStatus` / `ProviderDomainConflictError` / `ProviderDomainRejectedError` (`./provider`), `partnerSendingDomains` / `partners` (`../../db/schema`), `db` / `withSystemDbAccessContext` (`../../db`), `sendSendingDomainStatusEmail` (`./statusMail`), `createAuditLogAsync` (`../auditService`), `ANONYMOUS_ACTOR_ID` (`../auditEvents`), `nextCheckDelayMs` (same file).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type SyncOutcome =
    | 'no_provider' | 'not_found' | 'provisioned' | 'provision_failed'
    | 'polled' | 'expired' | 'released' | 'deleted' | 'suspended_noop';
  export interface SyncOptions { lastSendError?: string; now?: Date; rng?: () => number }
  export async function syncSendingDomain(domainId: string, opts?: SyncOptions): Promise<SyncOutcome>;
  /** `static` only: an accepted test send IS the verification (spec §5.1). Returns false when it does not apply. */
  export async function markStaticDomainVerified(domainId: string, now?: Date): Promise<boolean>;
  export const FAILED_RETRY_WINDOW_MS: number;   // 72h, spec §4.3/§6.1
  ```

- [ ] **Step 0: Register the file in `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`**

In `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`, add to `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` (`:64`), beside W02's `services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts` entry:

```ts
  'services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts': 'the sending-domain state machine runs only inside the sending-domains BullMQ worker, under system DB scope, with no caller and no auth context: it takes a domain id from a job payload, advances that ONE row between provider-observed statuses, and creates no partner-owned configuration. Every caller-facing create/update/delete of partner_sending_domains goes through routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts, which carries the canManagePartnerWidePolicies gate',
```

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`
Expected: **FAIL** on "the allowlist has no stale entries" — `domainSync.ts` does not mutate a partner-axis table yet. That red is the proof the entry is real; it goes green at Step 4 once the implementation lands. (The reverse order — implement first — would instead red the "every caller-facing partner-axis write site consults the capability helper" case, which is the same contract seen from the other side.)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts` (and extend its imports to `import { FAILED_RETRY_WINDOW_MS, markStaticDomainVerified, nextCheckDelayMs, syncSendingDomain } from './domainSync';`, with the mock block placed at the very top of the file, above the existing cadence `describe`):

```ts

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it green**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`
Expected: 8 + 27 in `domainSync.test.ts`, 0 failed; and `partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` now green — the Step 0 entry has stopped being stale because the file mutates `partnerSendingDomains`, and the sweep does not flag it because it is allowlisted.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): syncSendingDomain state machine (spec 6.1)

provision_attempted_at commits before the provider create so a crashed attempt
is re-adopted as ours; provider_managed=false is never deleted at the provider
on any of the three removal paths.

### Task 4: The `sending-domains` worker

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/keyProbe.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts:156` — add one key after `'monitor-episode-retention': '3 20 * * *',`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `syncSendingDomain` / `FAILED_RETRY_WINDOW_MS` (`../services/emailDomains/domainSync`), `getEmailDomainProvider` (`../services/emailDomains/providerRegistry`), `isPartnerLaneConfigured` (`../services/emailDomains/config`), `getBullMQConnection` (`../services/redis`), `attachWorkerObservability` (`./workerObservability`), `jobSchedule` (`./scheduleRegistry`), `sendOpsAlert` (`../services/opsAlerts`), `isHosted` (`../config/env`), `db` / `withSystemDbAccessContext` (`../db`).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export const SENDING_DOMAINS_QUEUE = 'sending-domains';
  export async function enqueueSyncDomain(domainId: string, opts?: { lastSendError?: string }): Promise<void>;
  export async function enqueueTestSend(domainId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>;
  export async function initializeSendingDomainsWorker(): Promise<void>;
  export async function shutdownSendingDomainsWorker(): Promise<void>;
  export async function runSendingDomainsSweep(now?: Date): Promise<{ enqueued: number; released: number; stuck: number }>;
  export async function runDailyMaintenance(now?: Date): Promise<{ drift: number; rechecked: number }>;
  export async function runTestSend(domainId: string, userId: string): Promise<'sent' | 'refused' | 'skipped'>;
  ```
  And in `keyProbe.ts`:
  ```ts
  export type ProviderKeyProbe = 'ok' | 'send_only';
  export async function recordProviderKeyProbe(verdict: ProviderKeyProbe): Promise<void>;
  export async function readProviderKeyProbe(): Promise<ProviderKeyProbe | null>;
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1: Allocate the cron slot**

In `apps/api/src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts`, immediately after line 156 (`'monitor-episode-retention': '3 20 * * *',`), add:

```ts
  // Partner sending domains W03 (spec §6.4). ONE daily job doing two things:
  // the hosted drift report (listDomains vs local rows + outbox) and, on a
  // `static` instance, the re-check that a domain the operator removed from
  // EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED stops being used. A slot rather than
  // `repeat: { every: 24h }` — BullMQ anchors `every` to the epoch, so a 24 h
  // repeatable fires at exactly 00:00:00.000 UTC alongside every other one (see
  // this file's header). Hour 21 was entirely free; :03 keeps the daily = 3
  // (mod 5) lane.
  'sending-domains-daily': '3 21 * * *',
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test**

 * rendered by a route in the API process — a module flag would always read
 * "not probed" there. Redis is the only state both processes already share.
 *

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the worker tests and the schedule contract**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.test.ts`
Expected: all green. The contract suite proves no coarse `every` was introduced, that `'sending-domains-daily'` is allocated exactly once, and that `3 21 * * *` collides with nothing.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.ts apps/api/src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts apps/api/src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/keyProbe.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): sending-domains worker (sweep, outbox drain, test send, daily maintenance)

Daily work takes an allocated cron slot, never repeat:{every:24h} — BullMQ
anchors `every` to the epoch and every 24h repeatable fires at 00:00 UTC.

### Task 5: Register the worker (registry, readiness rule, both boot paths)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.ts:1420-1431` — add one entry after the `toolSourceDiscoveryWorker` entry, still inside `WORKER_REGISTRY`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts:5-10` (rule union), `:264` (manifest row, after `consumers('toolSourceDiscoveryWorker'),`), `:274-296` (`ruleEnabled`), `:298-307` (`declareExpectedConsumers` input)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts:1170-1179` (the `declareExpectedConsumers` call) and its import block near `:231`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/worker.ts:595-604` (the `declareExpectedConsumers` call) and its import block near `:96`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.test.ts:49-64`, `:77-86`, `:175`, `:219-231`, `:261`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `initializeSendingDomainsWorker` / `shutdownSendingDomainsWorker` (Task 4), `isPartnerLaneConfigured` (W02).
- Produces: registry entry `sendingDomainsWorker` (`placement: 'global'`); `ConsumerRequirementRule` gains `'sending_domains_configured'`; `declareExpectedConsumers` input gains `sendingDomainsConfigured: boolean`.

> **Why `placement: 'global'`, verified not guessed.** `workerRegistry.ts:46-48` forbids guessing. The runtime import closure of `jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.ts` was walked (transitive relative imports, `import type` ignored) over `services/email.ts`, `services/opsAlerts.ts`, `services/partnerTrust.ts`, `services/auditEvents.ts`, `db/index.ts`, `db/schema/index.ts`, `services/redis.ts`, `jobs/workerObservability.ts` and `db/partnerAxisRead.ts` — none reaches `routes/agentWs.ts` or `services/agentCommandAwait.ts`. The same walk correctly flags `jobs/m365SyncWorker.ts` and `jobs/orgMerge.ts` as `socket-owner`, which is how their registry entries are classified, so the tool is not returning false negatives. `services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` remains the final authority and runs in Step 5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing registration test**

Create `apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts`:

```ts
// apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { WORKER_REGISTRY } from './workerRegistry';
import { WORKER_READINESS_MANIFEST } from '../jobs/workerReadinessManifest';

describe('sendingDomainsWorker registration (W03, partner sending domains)', () => {
  it('is registered in WORKER_REGISTRY as a global-placement, lazily-loaded entry', async () => {
    const entry = WORKER_REGISTRY.find((e) => e.name === 'sendingDomainsWorker');
    expect(entry).toBeDefined();
    expect(entry?.placement).toBe('global');
    const loaded = await entry!.load();
    expect(typeof loaded.init).toBe('function');
    expect(typeof loaded.shutdown).toBe('function');
  });

  it('is declared CONDITIONALLY, so an unconfigured instance is never pinned not-ready', () => {
    const entry = WORKER_READINESS_MANIFEST.find(
      (e) => e.kind === 'consumers' && e.initializer === 'sendingDomainsWorker',
    );
    expect(entry).toBeDefined();
    expect(entry).toMatchObject({
      consumers: ['sendingDomainsWorker'],
      requiredWhen: 'sending_domains_configured',
    });
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts`
Expected: both cases fail — `expected undefined to be defined`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the registry entry**

In `apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.ts`, immediately after the `toolSourceDiscoveryWorker` entry's closing `},` (line 1431) and before the array's `];`, add:

```ts
  {
    // Partner sending domains W03. The ONE place that calls the email-domain
    // provider (spec §2). `initializeSendingDomainsWorker` returns before
    // constructing anything when EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER is unset, which is the
    // default — hence the matching 'sending_domains_configured' readiness rule.
    // placement 'global': the module's runtime import closure (domainSync ->
    // providerRegistry/adapters -> services/email.ts, opsAlerts, partnerTrust,
    // auditEvents, db, redis) reaches neither routes/agentWs.ts nor
    // services/agentCommandAwait.ts.
    name: 'sendingDomainsWorker',
    placement: 'global',
    load: async () => {
      const m = await import('../jobs/sendingDomainsWorker');
      return { init: m.initializeSendingDomainsWorker, shutdown: m.shutdownSendingDomainsWorker };
    },
  },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the readiness rule and wire both boot paths**

`apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts`, the `ConsumerRequirementRule` union at `:5-10` — add the last member:

```ts
export type ConsumerRequirementRule =
  | 'redis'                   // required whenever Redis is available
  | 'abuse_or_partner_trust_enabled' // shared abuse/partner-trust consumer
  | 'audit_chain_verify_enabled' // audit verification kill switch
  | 'event_dispatch_enabled'  // D3a: eventDispatch (EVENT_DISPATCH_MODE !== 'off')
  | 'ai_agents_enabled'       // D3a: aiAgentRunner (AI_AGENTS_ENABLED)
  | 'sending_domains_configured'; // W03: sendingDomainsWorker (EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER set)
```

After `consumers('toolSourceDiscoveryWorker'),` (`:264`), add:

```ts
  // Partner sending domains W03. initializeSendingDomainsWorker returns before
  // constructing a Worker when EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER is unset — the default on
  // every self-hosted install and on hosted until W05 — so a plain-required row
  // would leave every api/all process permanently not-ready. Same shape and
  // same reason as aiAgentRunner above.
  consumers('sendingDomainsWorker', ['sendingDomainsWorker'], 'sending_domains_configured'),
```

In `ruleEnabled` (`:274-296`) add the field to the input type and the case:

```ts
function ruleEnabled(
  rule: ConsumerRequirementRule,
  input: {
    partnerTrustEnabled: boolean;
    auditChainVerifyEnabled: boolean;
    abuseSignalsEnabled: boolean;
    eventDispatchEnabled: boolean;
    aiAgentsEnabled: boolean;
    sendingDomainsConfigured: boolean;
  },
): boolean {
  switch (rule) {
    case 'redis':
      return true;
    case 'abuse_or_partner_trust_enabled':
      return input.abuseSignalsEnabled || input.partnerTrustEnabled;
    case 'audit_chain_verify_enabled':
      return input.auditChainVerifyEnabled;
    case 'event_dispatch_enabled':
      return input.eventDispatchEnabled;
    case 'ai_agents_enabled':
      return input.aiAgentsEnabled;
    case 'sending_domains_configured':
      return input.sendingDomainsConfigured;
  }
}
```

And the exported input at `:298-307` gains `sendingDomainsConfigured: boolean;` after `aiAgentsEnabled: boolean;`.

`apps/api/src/index.ts`: add `import { isPartnerLaneConfigured } from './services/emailDomains/config';` to the import block that ends at `:232`, and extend the call at `:1170-1179`:

```ts
  declareExpectedConsumers({
    role: breezeRole(),
    redisAvailable,
    abuseSignalsEnabled: abuseSignalsEnabled(),
    partnerTrustEnabled: partnerTrustMode() !== 'off',
    auditChainVerifyEnabled: auditChainVerifyEnabled(),
    eventDispatchEnabled: eventDispatchMode() !== 'off',
    aiAgentsEnabled: AI_AGENTS_ENABLED,
    sendingDomainsConfigured: isPartnerLaneConfigured(),
    registry: workerReadinessRegistry,
  });
```

`apps/api/src/worker.ts`: add `import { isPartnerLaneConfigured } from './services/emailDomains/config';` beside the `partnerTrustMode` import at `:98`, and make the same one-line addition to the call at `:595-604`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the manifest's own rule mirror**

`apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.test.ts` mirrors the rules locally so the count tests cannot drift from the semantics tests. Five edits:

At `:49-64`, extend `Flags`, `ALL_ON` and `DEFAULT_FLAGS`:
```ts
interface Flags {
  partnerTrustEnabled: boolean;
  auditChainVerifyEnabled: boolean;
  abuseSignalsEnabled: boolean;
  eventDispatchEnabled: boolean;
  aiAgentsEnabled: boolean;
  sendingDomainsConfigured: boolean;
}
const ALL_ON: Flags = {
  partnerTrustEnabled: true, auditChainVerifyEnabled: true, abuseSignalsEnabled: true,
  eventDispatchEnabled: true, aiAgentsEnabled: true, sendingDomainsConfigured: true,
};
// Default configuration: opt-in flags off, audit verification on.
const DEFAULT_FLAGS: Flags = {
  partnerTrustEnabled: false, auditChainVerifyEnabled: true, abuseSignalsEnabled: false,
  eventDispatchEnabled: false, aiAgentsEnabled: false, sendingDomainsConfigured: false,
};
```

At `:77-86`, add the case to `ruleIsOn`:
```ts
    case 'sending_domains_configured': return flags.sendingDomainsConfigured;
```

At `:175` and at `:261`, the two hard-coded optional-consumer lists gain the new name (both are sorted):
```ts
    expect(optional).toEqual(['abuseSignalsWorker', 'aiAgentRunner', 'eventDispatch', 'eventDispatchMaintenance', 'sendingDomainsWorker']);
```
and rename the second test so the count in its title stays truthful:
```ts
  it('on a default all box exactly five consumers are optional (names, not a number)', () => {
```

At `:219-231`, add a row to the rule table so the new rule gets the same on/off proof as the other four:
```ts
    ['sending_domains_configured', 'sendingDomainsWorker', 'worker', { ...ALL_ON, sendingDomainsConfigured: false }],
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run everything registration touches**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.test.ts src/services/workerRegistry.test.ts src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts src/worker.boot.test.ts`
Expected: all green. `workerReadinessManifest.test.ts`'s "classifies every initializeWorkers group exactly once" proves the registry entry and the manifest row agree; `workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts` is the authority on the `'global'` placement and will fail if the closure actually reaches `routes/agentWs.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Typecheck the two boot paths**

Run: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json`
Expected: clean. A missing `sendingDomainsConfigured` at either call site is a compile error, which is the point of putting it on the required input rather than defaulting it.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.ts apps/api/src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.ts apps/api/src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.test.ts apps/api/src/index.ts apps/api/src/worker.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): register sendingDomainsWorker behind a sending_domains_configured readiness rule

A plain redis-required row would pin every unconfigured api/all process
not-ready, since the initializer returns before constructing a Worker.

- [ ] **Step 0: Register the file in `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`**

In `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`, add to `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` (`:64`):

```ts
  'services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.ts': 'the partner-wide gate for every caller-facing sending-domain write lives one layer up, in routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts, which calls canManagePartnerWidePolicies on all six mutating routes; this service takes the partner id from the verified auth context its route passed, never from request input, and its remaining callers are the platform-admin routes (already behind platformAdminMiddleware + requireMfa) and the sending-domains worker, which has no caller at all',
```

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`
Expected: **FAIL** on "the allowlist has no stale entries" until Step 3 lands the file. Same discipline as Task 3 Step 0.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it green**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`
Expected: 36 passed in the service suite; `partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` green (the Step 0 entry is no longer stale, and the sweep does not flag the file).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.test.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): sending domain service (create, check, remove, identities, admin, capability)

Creates use onConflictDoNothing so a UNIQUE(domain) race never raises 23505
inside the request transaction, and both conflict causes return the identical
non-revealing 409 (spec 4.3).

### Task 7: `routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `authMiddleware` / `requireMfa` / `requirePermission` / `requireScope` / `requirePartner` (`../middleware/auth`), `requireCapability` (`../services/partnerTrust`), `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` + `PARTNER_WIDE_WRITE_DENIED_MESSAGE` (`../services/partnerWideAccess`), `writeRouteAudit` (`../services/auditEvents`), `zValidator` (`../lib/validation`), `PERMISSIONS` (`../services/permissions`), `rateLimiter` (`../services/rate-limit`), `getRedis` (`../services/redis`), every exported function of `../services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService`, `enqueueTestSend` (`../jobs/sendingDomainsWorker`).
- Produces: `export const partnerSendingDomainsRoutes: Hono`, mounted at `/partner/sending-domains`.

> The middleware stack is copied from `PATCH /partners/me` (`routes/orgs.ts:904-922`) **in full**: `requireScope('partner')` → `requirePartner` → `requireOrgWrite` → `requireMfa()` → the inline `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` denial → `requireCapability('custom_sending_domain')` → `zValidator`. `requireOrgWrite` is not importable — it is built locally from `requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.ORGS_WRITE…)`, exactly as `orgs.ts:102-104` does. The partner-wide gate is the piece spec §7's prose summary leaves out and `orgs.ts:911-916` actually has: a sending domain applies to **every org under the MSP**, so an `orgAccess: 'selected'` user must not be able to add, re-point or remove it (the `partnerServicePrincipals.ts` lesson from the 2026-08-16 review, and plan amendment 11).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it green**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts`
Expected: 23 passed in the route suite; the coverage contract still green.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts apps/api/src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): partner sending-domain routes (spec 7)

No handler calls the provider; routes write intent rows and enqueue. The test
send always addresses the calling user, never a body-supplied address.

### Task 8: `routes/admin/sendingDomains.ts`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/admin/sendingDomains.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/admin/sendingDomains.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `requireMfa` (`../../middleware/auth`), `zValidator` (`../../lib/validation`), `writeRouteAudit` (`../../services/auditEvents`), `forceReleaseSendingDomain` / `listAllSendingDomains` / `suspendSendingDomain` / `unsuspendSendingDomain` / `SendingDomainServiceError` (`../../services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService`).
- Produces: `export const adminSendingDomainsRoutes: Hono`, mounted by the hub at `/admin/sending-domains`.

> `platformAdminMiddleware` is **not** applied here: `routes/admin/index.ts:15` already applies it to everything it mounts, exactly as `routes/admin/trust.ts` relies on. This file adds `requireMfa()` per mutating route, the same posture as `tenantErasureRoutes` (`routes/admin/index.ts:20-22`).

### Task 9: Mount both route groups and prove they are reachable

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts` — add one import beside `import { partnerTrustRoutes } from './routes/partnerTrust';` (`:131`), and one `api.route(...)` line between `:1001` and `:1004`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/admin/index.ts:10-11` (import) and `:36` (mount)
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `partnerSendingDomainsRoutes` (Task 7), `adminSendingDomainsRoutes` (Task 8).
- Produces: `GET /api/v1/partner/sending-domains` and `GET /api/v1/admin/sending-domains` reachable through the real composition roots.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `apps/api/src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts`:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { Hono } from 'hono';

// Reach each router through the REAL admin hub, and assert the index.ts mount
// statically. Importing index.ts itself would boot the server and every worker.
vi.mock('../middleware/platformAdmin', () => ({
  platformAdminMiddleware: async (c: any, next: any) => {
    c.set('auth', { scope: 'system', partnerId: null, user: { id: '55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555555' } });
    return next();
  },
}));
vi.mock('../middleware/auth', async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import('../middleware/auth')>();
  return {
    ...actual,
    authMiddleware: async (c: any, next: any) => {
      c.set('auth', { scope: 'partner', partnerId: '11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111', user: { id: 'u1' } });
      c.set('permissions', { permissions: [{ resource: '*', action: '*' }] });
      return next();
    },
    requireMfa: () => async (_c: any, next: any) => next(),
  };
});
vi.mock('../services/emailDomains/config', () => ({ isPartnerLaneConfigured: () => false }));
vi.mock('../services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService', () => ({
  SendingDomainServiceError: class extends Error {},
  listAllSendingDomains: vi.fn(async () => []),
  suspendSendingDomain: vi.fn(),
  unsuspendSendingDomain: vi.fn(),
  forceReleaseSendingDomain: vi.fn(),
  listSendingDomains: vi.fn(),
  createSendingDomain: vi.fn(),
  requestDomainCheck: vi.fn(),
  requestDomainRemoval: vi.fn(),
  upsertSenderIdentity: vi.fn(),
  deleteSenderIdentity: vi.fn(),
  getSendingDomainsCapability: vi.fn(),
}));
vi.mock('../jobs/sendingDomainsWorker', () => ({ enqueueTestSend: vi.fn() }));

const indexSource = readFileSync(join(__dirname, '..', 'index.ts'), 'utf8');

describe('index.ts mounts the partner router', () => {
  it('registers /partner/sending-domains', () => {
    expect(indexSource).toContain("import { partnerSendingDomainsRoutes } from './routes/partnerSendingDomains';");
    expect(indexSource.indexOf("api.route('/partner/sending-domains', partnerSendingDomainsRoutes);")).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
  });

  it('registers it BEFORE the catch-all /partner router, or /sending-domains is eaten', () => {
    const specific = indexSource.indexOf("api.route('/partner/sending-domains'");
    const catchAll = indexSource.indexOf("api.route('/partner', partnerRoutes);");
    expect(specific).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
    expect(catchAll).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
    expect(specific).toBeLessThan(catchAll);
  });
});

describe('the routers are reachable through the real composition roots', () => {
  it('the admin hub serves /admin/sending-domains under platformAdminMiddleware', async () => {
    const { adminRoutes } = await import('./admin');
    const app = new Hono();
    app.route('/admin', adminRoutes);
    const res = await app.request('/admin/sending-domains');
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    expect(await res.json()).toEqual({ data: [] });
  });

  it('the partner router answers through its own auth gate and reports the dark default', async () => {
    const { partnerSendingDomainsRoutes } = await import('./partnerSendingDomains');
    const app = new Hono();
    app.route('/partner/sending-domains', partnerSendingDomainsRoutes);
    const res = await app.request('/partner/sending-domains');
    expect(res.status).toBe(404);
    expect(await res.json()).toEqual({ error: 'sending_domains_unsupported' });
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and watch it fail**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts`
Expected: the two static assertions fail (`expected -1 to be greater than -1`) and the admin-hub case 404s, because neither mount exists yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mount them**

`apps/api/src/index.ts`, beside the `partnerTrustRoutes` import at `:131`:
```ts
import { partnerSendingDomainsRoutes } from './routes/partnerSendingDomains';
```
and between `api.route('/partner/ai/script-policy', partnerAiScriptPolicyRoutes);` (`:1003`) and `api.route('/partner', partnerRoutes);` (`:1004`):
```ts
// W03 (partner sending domains). MUST stay above the catch-all `/partner`
// mount below, the same ordering `/partner/trust` relies on — Hono matches in
// registration order, so a later specific mount is never reached.
api.route('/partner/sending-domains', partnerSendingDomainsRoutes);
```

`apps/api/src/routes/admin/index.ts`, after the `trustActionAdminRoutes` import (`:11`):
```ts
import { adminSendingDomainsRoutes } from './sendingDomains';
```
and after the `ai-kill-state` mount (`:36`):
```ts
// Partner sending domains W03: cross-partner list plus the kill switch
// (suspend / unsuspend / force-release, spec §9.1). Mounted UNDER the
// platformAdminMiddleware above; the router adds its own requireMfa() on each
// mutating verb.
adminRoutes.route('/sending-domains', adminSendingDomainsRoutes);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the mounting test plus the router auth contract**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts src/__tests__/routerAuthGate.contract.test.ts`
Expected: both green. `routerAuthGate.contract.test.ts` discovers the new `api.route` mount automatically and drives `partnerSendingDomainsRoutes` with no credentials — it must answer 401, which it does because the router applies `authMiddleware` to `*` before the unsupported-instance 404.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/index.ts apps/api/src/routes/admin/index.ts apps/api/src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(email-domains): mount partner and admin sending-domain routers

/partner/sending-domains is registered above the catch-all /partner mount.

### Task 10: Real-Postgres proof for the release order and the sweep claim

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts` — append one `describe` block at the end of the file (the file is created by W02; keep its existing imports and its `afterAll` cleanup, and extend the cleanup's id arrays if the block seeds its own rows)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `syncSendingDomain` (Task 3), `runSendingDomainsSweep` (Task 4), `resetEmailDomainProviderForTests` + the `fake` adapter (W02), `createPartner` / `createUser` (`./db-utils`), `withDbAccessContext` / `withSystemDbAccessContext` (`../../db`).
- Produces: nothing exported; it is the only test that can see the `BEFORE DELETE` guard and the RLS visibility of the sweep's claim, because both are enforced by Postgres and invisible to a mocked db.

> Why this cannot be a unit test: the `BEFORE DELETE` trigger and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` are database behaviour. The mocked suites in Tasks 3 and 4 assert the *order of calls*; only real Postgres proves the trigger actually raises when the order is wrong, and that the sweep's claim runs under a scope that can see rows at all. The `tunnel-allowlist-duplicate-savepoint` incident is the repo's standing example of a mocked suite staying green through a production-only failure.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing block**

Append to `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts`:

Add to the file's imports (keeping W02's): `import { runSendingDomainsSweep } from '../../jobs/sendingDomainsWorker';`, `import { syncSendingDomain } from '../../services/emailDomains/domainSync';`, `import { resetEmailDomainProviderForTests } from '../../services/emailDomains/providerRegistry';`, and add `emailProviderDomainReleases` / `partnerSendingDomains` to the schema import if W02's file does not already pull them in.

- [ ] **Step 2: Bring up a database and run it**

Run:
```bash
pnpm test-stack up
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts
```
Expected before the implementation of Tasks 3-4 is present: the block fails on the missing imports. With them present: W02's cases plus these three pass. The first case's CONTROL assertion must genuinely fail the delete — if `guardMessage` comes back `undefined`, W02's `BEFORE DELETE` trigger is not installed and the rest of the case proves nothing; fix that before continuing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(email-domains): real-Postgres proof of the release order and the system-scoped sweep claim

Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 11: Verification

**Files:** none changed. This task only runs things.

- [ ] **Step 1: Typecheck the API package**

Run: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json`
Expected: no errors. (This is the exact command `.github/workflows/ci.yml:295` runs; there is no `typecheck` script in `apps/api/package.json`.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Lint the files this wave touched**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx eslint src/services/emailDomains src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.ts src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.ts src/routes/admin/sendingDomains.ts`
Expected: clean.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run every unit file this wave added or changed**

Run:
```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run \
  src/services/emailDomains/domainSync.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/statusMail.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/sendingDomainService.test.ts \
  src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts \
  src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.test.ts \
  src/jobs/scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts \
  src/jobs/workerReadinessManifest.test.ts \
  src/services/workerRegistry.test.ts \
  src/services/workerRegistry.sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts \
  src/services/workerEntrypointClosure.contract.test.ts \
  src/worker.boot.test.ts \
  src/routes/partnerSendingDomains.test.ts \
  src/routes/admin/sendingDomains.test.ts \
  src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/routerAuthGate.contract.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts
```
Expected: all green. Check the reported **file count is 16** — vitest's path filter is a plain substring match, so a typo silently runs fewer files than intended rather than erroring.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the whole API unit suite**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run`
Expected: green. The suites most likely to be disturbed by this wave, and why, so a failure is diagnosable rather than mysterious: `workerReadinessCoverage.test.ts` (one `new Worker(` must be matched by one `attachWorkerObservability(` in `sendingDomainsWorker.ts`), `workerReadinessManifest.test.ts` (the optional-consumer lists), `scheduleRegistry.contract.test.ts` (the new cron slot), `routerAuthGate.contract.test.ts` (the new mount), `partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` (the two allowlist entries and the route gate), and W01's `mailPurposes` property test (the new purpose must have a send site — `statusMail.ts` is it).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the contract suites against a real database**

Run:
```bash
pnpm test-stack up
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts
cd apps/api && npm run test:rls
cd apps/api && npm run test:rls-coverage
```
Expected: green. Note `test:integration` does **not** accept a path after `--` (that runs the whole suite); pass the path to `npx vitest run --config …` directly as above.

- [ ] **Step 6: Confirm the wave really is dark**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/sendingDomainsMounting.test.ts src/jobs/sendingDomainsWorker.test.ts -t "dark default"`
Expected: the two "dark default" cases pass — with `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` unset the routes answer `404 sending_domains_unsupported` and no Worker is constructed. Also confirm by hand that `git grep -n "EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER" -- '.env.example' 'deploy/.env.example'` shows the variable commented out or absent, i.e. this PR does not turn the feature on anywhere.

- [ ] **Step 7: Tear the stack down**

Run: `pnpm test-stack down`
Expected: the worktree's private Postgres and Redis are gone. Nothing else reaps them.

- [ ] **Step 8: Open the PR**

Body must contain `Closes #6183`, the list of plan amendments above, and an explicit statement that the wave lands dark (provider unset → routes 404, worker not registered). Request one independent review round (high rigor: tenancy, partner cascade, abuse surface).

## Self-review

Every in-scope spec requirement, mapped to the task that satisfies it and the test that proves it.

| Spec requirement | Task | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| §2 — all provider management calls happen in ONE worker; request handlers only write intent rows | 4, 7, 8 | `partnerSendingDomains.test.ts` / `admin/sendingDomains.test.ts` source scans ("does not import providerRegistry or any adapter"); `getEmailDomainProvider` is imported only by `domainSync.ts` and `sendingDomainsWorker.ts` |
| §2 — one partner-lane account per instance; drift reported, never auto-repaired | 4 | `runDailyMaintenance` alerts and asserts `deleteDomain` was not called |
| §4.3 — `409 domain_unavailable`, one message for both causes, no information about who holds it | 6 | "gives BOTH conflict causes the identical non-revealing message" |
| §4.3 — creates rate-limited 5/day/partner | 6 | "enforces 5 creates a day per partner" (key, limit and window asserted) |
| §4.3 — failed rows auto-removed 72 h after the failure | 3 | "moves a failed row past the 72h window to removing/failed_expired" + the inside-window negative |
| §4.4 — local-part shape, reserved names, display-name spoof, From is always `local_part@domain` | 6 | "refuses the reserved local parts", "refuses a display name that looks like another address" |
| §5.1 — find-then-create four-case classification; `provision_attempted_at` committed before the provider call | 3 | "commits provision_attempted_at BEFORE calling the provider" + the four case tests + the ambiguous case |
| §5.1 — adopted already-verified domain is verified at once | 3 | "an adopted already-verified domain is verified at once" |
| §5.1 — `static` waits in `pending` for its test send; acceptance verifies it | 3, 4 | "a static row waits in pending"; `runTestSend` enqueues a sync for a `pending` non-DNS row |
| §5.1 — send-only key degrades the capability instead of failing every request | 4, 6 | "records send_only on a permission error"; "is unsupported with provider_key_send_only" |
| §5.2 — status mapping, unknown state never sends | 3 | `mapProviderState` + "maps the provider state, advances the cadence" |
| §6.1 `sync-domain` — every transition, `jobId = domainId` | 3, 4 | the 21-case state-machine block; "collapses duplicate sync jobs" |
| §6.1 — `check_requested_at` → `requestVerification` only when `verifiesByDns` | 3 | "honours a Check now … but only when the adapter verifies by DNS" |
| §6.1 — `removing` → `deleteDomain` only when `provider_managed`, then null, then delete | 3, 10 | "removing a MANAGED domain … in that order"; the real-Postgres guard case |
| §6.1 — `suspended` makes no provider calls | 3 | "suspended makes no provider call at all" |
| §6.1 `sweep` — due rows, `LIMIT 25`, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, outbox drain, ops alert past 10 attempts | 4, 10 | the sweep block; the real-Postgres claim case |
| §6.1 `test-send` — direct adapter send, From from the support identity else `test`, To the caller | 4, 7 | `runTestSend`; "enqueues the job with the CALLING user, never a typed address" |
| §6.1 — `static` re-checked on worker start and daily | 4 | "also enqueues one un-repeated daily-maintenance at boot"; "re-checks every live static row" |
| §6.2 — cadence, per-row jitter on the 24 h interval | 1 | the eight cadence cases, incl. "spreads verified rows rather than stacking them" |
| §6.3 — every status change writes an audit entry and mails the adder plus partner admins | 2, 3 | "emails the adder plus every active Partner Admin"; "emails and audits only on a CHANGE of status" |
| §6.4 — drift report hosted-only, never deletes | 4 | "runs the drift report on HOSTED only"; "alerts … and deletes nothing" |
| §7 — the seven partner routes, their verbs and status codes | 7 | the `routes` block (one case per route) |
| §7 — reads `requireScope('partner')` + `requirePartner`; writes add `requireOrgWrite`, `requireMfa()`, `requireCapability('custom_sending_domain')` | 7 | "gate registration" + the four authz-matrix cases |
| §7 — `404 sending_domains_unsupported` when no provider | 7 | "404s every route with sending_domains_unsupported" (all seven paths) |
| §7 — `writeRouteAudit` on every write | 7, 8 | each write case asserts the audit call; the error cases assert it is *not* written |
| §7 — platform admin list / suspend / unsuspend / force-release under `platformAdminMiddleware` + `requireMfa()` | 8, 9 | `admin/sendingDomains.test.ts`; "the admin hub serves /admin/sending-domains under platformAdminMiddleware" |
| §9.1 — kill switch takes effect on the next send | 6 | "suspend sets suspended/platform_suspended"; resolution reads the row (W04 consumes it) |
| §9.1 — `EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER` cap | 6 | "enforces the per-partner cap" |
| §9.1 — dark-launch allowlist gates eligibility | 6 | "is ineligible when an allowlist is set and the partner is not on it" |
| §9.1 — eligibility via the trust capability, evaluated without side effects | 6 | "is ineligible with a reason when the side-effect-free trust evaluator denies"; "never writes a denial audit row" |
| §9.1 — audit on every mutation and every status transition | 3, 7, 8 | `commitTransition`'s audit write; every route write case |
| §13 — provider down during provisioning: row stays `provisioning`, job retries | 3, 4 | the job's `attempts: 5` exponential backoff; `provision` only transitions on a definitive answer |
| §13 — provider refuses: `failed` with the reason | 3 | "a provider refusal fails the row with its reason" |
| §13 — crash between provider create and the local update | 3 | "case 3 — found but created AFTER our attempt" |
| §13 — DNS removed after verification → `at_risk`, partner notified | 3 | "verified -> at_risk notifies once and keeps verified_at sticky" |
| §13 — provider delete fails: row stays `removing`, outbox backs off, ops alert after 10 | 3, 4 | "a provider delete failure leaves the row in removing"; "backs an outbox row off"; "raises an ops alert … past ten attempts" |
| §13 — partner suspended/restricted → resolution falls back; admin can force-release | 6 | `forceReleaseSendingDomain` cases (managed and unmanaged) |
| §13 — self-hosted removes a pre-existing domain: local row only | 3, 6, 10 | "removal of an UNMANAGED domain drops the local row only"; the unmanaged force-release case; the real-Postgres unmanaged case |
| §13 — operator delists a `static` domain → `failed`/`provider_rejected` on the next boot | 3, 4 | `poll` maps a `static` `getDomain` failure; "re-checks every live static row" |
| §14 — "never delete what we did not create" across removal, partner release and failed-row expiry | 3, 10 | three dedicated cases plus the real-Postgres one |
| §14 — state machine: every transition, idempotent re-runs, crash recovery, cadence, failed-row expiry | 1, 3 | the cadence block and the state-machine block |
| Index amendment 5 — `staff.sending_domain_status` added here **with its send site** | 2 | "is a PLATFORM purpose"; `statusMail.ts` is the send site W01's registry property test requires |
| Epic #2135 — a partner-wide write consults `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` | 7 | "403s EVERY write for a partner user without full partner access"; the source-scan case |
| `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` registration for both mutating service files | 3, 6 | `partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` runs in each task's green step and in verification |
| W02 amendment 4 — `createDomain` carries `partnerSlug` | 3 | "passes the partner SLUG to createDomain" |
| W02 amendment 5 — `static` `getDomain` keys on the domain name; `pending` is no change; only a test send verifies | 3, 4 | "does NOT demote a verified static row"; "keys a static getDomain on the DOMAIN NAME"; "DOES fail a static row the operator delisted"; the `markStaticDomainVerified` block; "an accepted static test send verifies the row THERE" |
| W02's typed provider errors drive `status_reason` | 3 | the `ProviderDomainConflictError` / `ProviderDomainRejectedError` `it.each`, plus the unclassified fallback |
| W02's DTO field sets and ISO-8601 strings are honoured exactly (incl. `statusChangedAt`, `domain`, `fromAddress`) | 6 | "fills every SendingDomainDto field, including statusChangedAt"; "joins each identity to its domain and computes fromAddress" |
| `email_provider_domain_releases.reason` stays inside its CHECK | 6 | "force-release of a MANAGED domain writes the outbox row" asserts `reason: 'force_release'` |
| `last_test_status` stays inside its CHECK (`pending`/`sent`/`failed`) | 4 | the test-send block asserts `lastTestStatus: 'sent'` and `'failed'` |
