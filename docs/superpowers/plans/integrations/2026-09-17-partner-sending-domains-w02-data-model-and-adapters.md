# Partner Sending Domains W02: Data Model, Config and Adapters — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

## Plan amendments

Deviations from the spec or the plan index, each forced by the real code. Every
one was verified by reading the file cited.

1. **`config/env.ts` is not the env declaration site.** Spec §11 says the new
   variables are "declared in `apps/api/src/config/env.ts`". That file contains
   no `EMAIL_*` name at all — it is a grab-bag of hand-written readers
   (`envFlag`, `isHosted` at `env.ts:321-323`). The real declaration site is the
   zod `envObjectSchema` in `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts` (existing email
   block at `validate.ts:804-809`). W02 declares the keys there and puts the
   typed reader in `services/emailDomains/config.ts`, modelled on
   `config/partnerTrustMode.ts` (call-time `process.env` read, `isHosted()`
   short-circuit, warn-and-fall-back on a bad value). **Nothing is added to
   `env.ts`.**
2. **The root `docker-compose.yml` must be mapped too**, not only
   `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` as spec §11 says.
   `apps/api/src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts` (required **Test API** job)
   asserts two pairs: `.env.example` ↔ `docker-compose.yml` and
   `deploy/.env.example` ↔ `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`. A var documented in
   one `.env.example` and absent from its paired compose file fails CI.
3. **A fifth registration list the spec missed.**
   `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` in
   `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts:64` derives the
   partner-axis table set from the **live Drizzle schema** (`partnerAxisTableNames()`,
   `:313-330`: any table with `partnerId` and no `notNull` `orgId`) and then
   greps every file under `src/routes/**` and `src/services/**` for
   `.insert|update|delete(<table>` without `canManagePartnerWidePolicies`.
   `services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts` mutates `partnerSendingDomains`, so
   it reds the required **Test API** job unless it is allowlisted with a reason
   of at least 20 characters. Spec §3.5 claims no list beyond
   `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` applies; that is wrong. Task 2 registers it.
4. **`createDomain` takes `partnerSlug`.** Spec §5's interface hands the adapter
   only `partnerRef` (the partner id), but the `static` allow-list binds entries
   by **slug** (`domain:partner-slug`, §2.1/§5.1). The input object gains
   `partnerSlug?: string | null`; `resend` and the future `ses` adapter ignore
   it. W03 resolves the slug from the `partners` row it already loads.
5. **`static`'s `getDomain(key)` keys on the domain name.**
   `provider_domain_id` is always null for `static` (§3.1), so there is no id to
   pass. The adapter's `getDomain` delegates to `findDomainByName`. It never
   returns `verified` — an accepted test send owns that transition (§5.1) — so
   W03's `syncSendingDomain` MUST treat a `pending` result from an adapter with
   `verifiesByDns === false` as "no change" and only act on `failed`. Stated
   here because W02 owns the adapter contract.
6. **The composite FK is NOT `DEFERRABLE`.** CLAUDE.md's deferrable rule is
   scoped to composite FKs on an **`org_id`** column, because the org merge runs
   `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED`. Verified: the only `SET CONSTRAINTS`
   statements in the repo are `services/orgMerge.ts:1060` and
   `services/quoteService.ts:1231`, both org-axis; there is no partner merge
   anywhere (`grep -rln "partnerMerge\|mergePartner" apps/api/src` → nothing).
   Precedent for a non-deferrable partner composite FK:
   `huntress_org_mappings_integration_partner_fkey`
   (`migrations/2026-06-12-a-huntress-partner-mapping.sql:59-63`) and the
   `pax8_*` twins. Plain `ON DELETE CASCADE`, no deferral.
7. **The `static` send-error classifier is text-based on the platform-transport
   path.** W01's `deliverRaw` inherits today's `sendEmail` body: the Resend
   branch throws `new Error('Resend error: ' + error.message)`
   (`services/email.ts:264-266`), discarding `error.name` and
   `error.statusCode`; the Mailgun branch throws
   `Mailgun API error (<status>): <body>` (`email.ts:804-808`); the SMTP branch
   does not catch at all (`email.ts:300`), so nodemailer's error arrives intact
   with `responseCode` / `response`. The classifier therefore keys on
   `responseCode`/`response` when present and on message text otherwise, with
   `ambiguous` as the default. Carrying a structured cause out of `deliverRaw`
   is a W04 follow-up, not a W02 change.
8. **Resend SDK 6.18.0's `DomainStatus` omits `temporary_failure`.** The
   installed union is
   `'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed' | 'not_started' | 'partially_verified' | 'partially_failed'`
   (`node_modules/resend/dist/index.d.mts:94`); `temporary_failure` exists only
   on `DomainRecordStatus` (`:93`). The API does return it at domain level
   (spec §0.2), so the mapper accepts it as a runtime string and maps it to
   `at_risk`, with `pending` + one warning for anything else.
9. **`isConsumerEmailDomain` takes an email address, not a domain**
   (`services/consumerEmailDomains.ts:79`, via `emailDomainOf` at `:66`). So
   `assertSendingDomainAllowed(domain)` calls it as
   `isConsumerEmailDomain('postmaster@' + domain)`.
10. **The outbox joins `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` only, not `EXEMPT_TABLES`.**
    `EXEMPT_TABLES` (`rls-coverage.integration.test.ts:57`) only subtracts from
    offender scans that reach a table through `org_id` auto-discovery or an
    explicit shape list. `email_provider_domain_releases` has neither, so it is
    never surfaced. Precedent: `sso_sessions`, `installed_extensions`,
    `extension_schema_history` are all in `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` and not in
    `EXEMPT_TABLES`.
11. **`EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` is declared `z.string().optional()`, not a zod
    enum.** Compose maps optional vars as `${VAR:-}`, so an unset var arrives as
    `""`; a bare `z.enum` would refuse boot on every upgraded deployment. The
    value check lives in the `superRefine` instead, where `""` and unset both
    mean "off".
12. **`tldts` is not installed anywhere in the repo** (verified across
    `package.json`, `apps/*/package.json`, `packages/*/package.json` and
    `node_modules`). Task 4 adds it to `apps/api` as a new dependency.

---

**Goal:** Land every artefact the partner-sending-domain feature needs before
anything calls out: three tables with partner-axis RLS and a `BEFORE DELETE`
release guard, their Drizzle models, the allowlist registrations, the shared
validators and DTOs W05's UI is built against, the `EMAIL_DOMAINS_*`
configuration with its deployment-mode boot rules, the `EmailDomainProvider`
interface with `resend` / `static` / `fake` adapters, the
`custom_sending_domain` capability, and the provider-release path wired into
`cascadeDeletePartner` and `finalizePartnerOffboarding`. With
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` unset — the default everywhere, hosted and self-hosted
— nothing in this wave changes behaviour for any tenant.

**Architecture:** One migration creates `partner_sending_domains` and
`partner_sender_identities` (RLS shape 3, partner-axis: one `FOR ALL TO
breeze_app` policy `breeze_current_scope() = 'system' OR
breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id)`, the
`2026-09-25-time-entry-source-and-suggestion-decisions.sql` template) plus
`email_provider_domain_releases`, a system-only outbox with **no `partner_id`
column** so `cascadeDeletePartner`'s `information_schema` sweep cannot erase the
provider handle it exists to keep. A `BEFORE DELETE` trigger on
`partner_sending_domains` raises when the row still owns a
`provider_domain_id`, so any delete path that forgets to release fails loudly;
`releaseSendingDomainsForPartner` is the one path that satisfies it, and it is
called first in both partner-destroying functions. The provider layer is a thin
interface with three adapters and a registry that returns `null` when
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` is unset — the single switch that keeps the wave dark.
Domain normalisation splits in two: the structural, platform-independent half
(`normalizeSendingDomain`) lives in `packages/shared` so the web reuses it; the
policy half (platform domains, consumer domains, public suffixes, the operator
denylist) lives in `services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.ts` because it reads
server configuration.

**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL + hand-written SQL migration, Drizzle ORM, Zod
(`packages/shared`), Vitest (unit + integration on real Postgres), the `resend`
npm SDK 6.18.0, `tldts` (new dependency), React (two small web edits for the
capability mirror).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-design.md`
§2.1 (deployment modes), §3.1–§3.5 (data model, registration and lifecycle
contracts), §4.1 and §4.4 (domain and identity rules), §5, §5.1, §5.2 (provider
interface, adapters, status model), §9.1 (eligibility capability, caps), §11
(configuration), §13 (error handling), §14 (testing).
Plan index: `docs/superpowers/plans/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains.md`
— amendment 1 (W02 split, release hooks ship here with the guard), amendment 3
(`PartnerLaneSendFailure` class), and the "Defined in W02" name list, which is
binding.

## Global Constraints

- **Migration name `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql`.**
  Before committing, run `ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1`. If the
  newest committed migration sorts at or after `2026-10-20-100000`, rename this
  file upward so it sorts last, and update every reference to it in this plan's
  test steps. Newest on `origin/main` when this plan was written:
  `2026-10-17-140000-snmp-metrics-instance-width.sql`.
- **The migration is idempotent and has no inner `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`.**
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`,
  `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` / `pg_policies` existence guards,
  `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` before `CREATE TRIGGER`, `DO $$` guards for the
  composite FK. `autoMigrate` wraps each file in one transaction.
- **It is DDL only — no `set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true)` is needed
  or permitted.** `apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts` requires the
  elevation only for files that `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`MERGE`. This
  migration writes no rows. **Never add this file to that test's frozen
  baseline.**
- **RLS lives in the creating migration.** Enable + force + policies for all
  three tables, plus `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ... TO breeze_app` —
  `cascadeDeletePartner` issues hard `DELETE`s as `breeze_app` under a system
  RLS context, so the DELETE grant is load-bearing.
- **`email_provider_domain_releases` MUST NOT have a `partner_id` column.**
  `cascadeDeletePartner` deletes from every `public` table that has one
  (`services/tenantCascade.ts:1762-1769`), which would erase the provider handle
  this table exists to keep.
- **Never delete a provider domain with `provider_managed = false`, and never
  write an outbox row for one.** A row adopted from the operator's own provider
  account is their primary sending domain; deleting it is unrecoverable.
- **Partner FKs carry no `ON DELETE CASCADE`** (spec §3.1). The partner sweep
  deletes these rows explicitly, and a database-level cascade would bypass the
  release guard.
- **No new env var is ever required by an upgrade.** Every `EMAIL_DOMAINS_*`
  key is optional. Any `requireIf` is keyed on `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` only,
  **never** on `EMAIL_PROVIDER` — `requireIf(EMAIL_PROVIDER === 'resend', …)`
  would refuse boot on every Resend self-host that upgrades.
- **Rigor is high** (tenancy, partner cascade, credentials). Red first on every
  task: write the failing assertion, run it, watch it fail, then implement.
  Before the PR, bring up a stack (`pnpm test-stack up`), run the RLS and
  integration contract suites, and tear it down (`pnpm test-stack down`) —
  nothing reaps it for you.
- **Test command form:** `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>` (never
  `pnpm --filter <pkg> test -- --run <path>`: pnpm forwards the literal `--`,
  vitest swallows `--run`, and the whole suite runs in watch mode).
  `packages/shared` and `apps/web` use the same `cd <dir> && npx vitest run
  <path>` form.
- **Branch `feature/6180-partner-sending-domains/wave-6182`; PR body
  contains `Closes #6182`.** `get_feature_status` before starting.
- **Commit after every task** with the trailer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Task 1: Migration and Drizzle schema

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql`
- Create: `apps/api/src/db/schema/emailSendingDomains.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/db/schema/index.ts` (append one `export * from` line after `export * from './toolSources';`, currently the last line, `:167`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: tables `partner_sending_domains`, `partner_sender_identities`,
  `email_provider_domain_releases`; function
  `public.breeze_sending_domain_release_guard()`; trigger
  `partner_sending_domains_release_guard`; Drizzle exports
  `partnerSendingDomains`, `partnerSenderIdentities`,
  `emailProviderDomainReleases` plus their `$inferSelect` type aliases.
- Consumes: `partners` (`db/schema/orgs.ts`), `users` (`db/schema/users.ts`),
  `public.breeze_current_scope()`, `public.breeze_has_partner_access(uuid)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the migration slot**

Run: `ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1`
Expected: a name sorting **before** `2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql`. If not, rename upward (e.g. `2026-10-21-100000-…`) and use the new name everywhere below.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the migration**

`apps/api/migrations/2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql`:

```sql
-- Partner sending domains (spec 2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-design §3).
-- W02 of the partner-sending-domains feature. Lands DARK: with
-- EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER unset nothing reads or writes these tables.
--
-- TENANCY:
--   partner_sending_domains, partner_sender_identities — RLS shape 3
--     (partner-axis). One FOR ALL TO breeze_app policy,
--     breeze_current_scope() = 'system' OR breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id),
--     on both USING and WITH CHECK. Template:
--     2026-09-25-time-entry-source-and-suggestion-decisions.sql.
--     Deliberately NO org_id and NO device_id, so they are registered in
--     PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES only — no CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER, no device
--     lists, no CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY, no org-merge registry.
--     cascadeDeletePartner discovers both by their partner_id column.
--   email_provider_domain_releases — INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED. Forced RLS with a
--     single system-only policy. It MUST NOT have a partner_id column:
--     cascadeDeletePartner deletes from every public table that has one
--     (services/tenantCascade.ts:1762-1769), which would erase the provider
--     handle this outbox exists to keep across the partner's deletion.
--
-- The partner FKs deliberately carry NO ON DELETE CASCADE (§3.1): the partner
-- sweep deletes these rows explicitly, and a database cascade would bypass the
-- release guard below.
--
-- The composite FK is NOT DEFERRABLE. CLAUDE.md's deferrable rule covers
-- composite FKs on an org_id column, because the ORG merge runs
-- SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED (services/orgMerge.ts:1060). There is no partner
-- merge in this repo. Precedent for a non-deferrable partner composite:
-- huntress_org_mappings_integration_partner_fkey (2026-06-12-a).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the migration guards**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql
scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --staged
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts
```
Expected: naming guard PASS; both suites PASS. `migrationRlsScope.test.ts` must pass **without** adding this file to its baseline — the migration writes no rows.

- [ ] **Step 5: Apply against a live database and check drift**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm test-stack up
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:check-drift
```
Expected: the migration applies; `db:check-drift` reports no drift. Leave the stack up for Task 12; it is torn down in Task 13.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql apps/api/src/db/schema/emailSendingDomains.ts apps/api/src/db/schema/index.ts
git commit -m "feat(db): partner sending domains, sender identities and the provider release outbox

Three tables for the partner sending-domain feature (spec §3). Both partner-axis
tables are RLS shape 3; the outbox is system-only and deliberately carries no
partner_id so cascadeDeletePartner cannot erase the provider handle. A BEFORE
DELETE guard on partner_sending_domains raises while the row still owns a
provider domain.

## Task 2: Registrations

Four registration facts, each verified against the real code:

| List | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` (`rls-coverage.integration.test.ts:186`) | **both partner tables** — mandatory. `it('every public base table is classified by exactly one tenancy bucket')` (`:1346`) reds on an unclassified table; `it('every partner-tenant public table has RLS on and all four DML commands covered by breeze_has_partner_access')` (`:1667`) then checks the policies. |
| `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` (`:87`) | **the outbox** — mandatory, same classification test. Not `EXEMPT_TABLES`: that set only subtracts from offender scans reached via `org_id` auto-discovery (`:1552` pins `col.column_name = 'org_id'`) or an explicit shape list, and the outbox is in neither. Precedent: `sso_sessions`, `installed_extensions`, `extension_schema_history`. |
| `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` (`partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts:64`) | **`services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts`** — mandatory (plan amendment 3). The partner-axis set is derived from the live Drizzle schema, so `partnerSendingDomains` joins it automatically the moment Task 1 lands. |
| `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`, `CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES`, `CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES`, `TICKET_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES`, `CUSTOM_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES`, `AUDIT_ADMIN_REQUIRED_TABLES`, `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`, `orgMergeRegistry` | **none apply.** All three tables have no `org_id`, no `device_id` and no `ticket_id`. `tenantCascade.integration.test.ts:55` only demands membership for tables with an `org_id` column (`:66` pins `c.column_name = 'org_id'`), and `tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts`'s `readLiveColumns()` (`:11-23`) selects only the tables already in `getOrgCascadeDeleteOrder()`. `cascadeDeletePartner` needs **no** registration: it discovers partner tables from `information_schema` at `services/tenantCascade.ts:1762-1769` and orders them with `topologicalCascadeOrder` (`:1125`), which puts `partner_sender_identities` before `partner_sending_domains` from the real FK edge. |

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` (`INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` — insert before the closing `]);` at `:118`; `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` — insert before the closing `]);` at `:319`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` (`ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`, insert before the closing `};` that follows the `services/orgArchive.ts` entry)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the three table names created in Task 1.
- Produces: nothing importable. These are contract-test registrations.

- [ ] **Step 1: Watch the classification contract fail**

Run (needs the stack from Task 1 Step 5):
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run --config vitest.config.rls-coverage.ts
```
Expected: FAIL on `every public base table is classified by exactly one tenancy bucket`, naming `partner_sending_domains`, `partner_sender_identities` and `email_provider_domain_releases` as unclassified.

Then:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts
```
Expected: PASS for now — `domainRelease.ts` does not exist until Task 11. Re-run it at the end of Task 11; the entry added below is what keeps it green then. (Adding the allowlist entry now would red `it('the allowlist has no stale entries')`, so **this entry is added in Task 11, not here.** Only the two `rls-coverage` edits happen in this task.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the two partner-axis tables**

In `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts`, immediately **before** the `]);` that closes `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` (`:319`), after the `['org_merge_events', 'partner_id'],` entry:

```ts
  // partner_sending_domains / partner_sender_identities (spec 2026-09-17,
  // partner sending domains W02): the MSP's custom outbound From domain and
  // one sender identity per (partner, mail stream). Partner-axis (Shape 3),
  // deliberately no org_id — the From domain is the MSP's identity, and a
  // per-org sending domain is the internal-phishing shape (spec §3.1). No
  // org_id means no cascade / export-policy / org-merge registration;
  // cascadeDeletePartner's dynamic partner_id sweep erases both, and its
  // topological order puts identities before domains via the composite FK.
  // GRANT includes DELETE for that sweep. The sibling outbox
  // email_provider_domain_releases is INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED above — it must
  // never gain a partner_id column.
  // Functional cross-partner forge proof: partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts.
  ['partner_sending_domains', 'partner_id'],
  ['partner_sender_identities', 'partner_id'],
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Register the outbox**

In the same file, immediately **before** the `]);` that closes `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` (`:118`), after the `'extension_schema_history', …` entry:

```ts
  'email_provider_domain_releases', // Provider-side "delete this domain" outbox (spec 2026-09-17 partner sending domains §3.3). Deliberately carries NO partner_id: cascadeDeletePartner deletes from every table that has one, which would erase the provider handle this table exists to keep across the partner's deletion. No tenant axis. Forced RLS, single system-only policy → only system context. Not in EXEMPT_TABLES: with no org_id and no shape-list entry, no offender scan reaches it.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the contract suite green**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run --config vitest.config.rls-coverage.ts
```
Expected: PASS, including the partner-tenant policy test at `:1667` (the migration's `FOR ALL` policy references `breeze_has_partner_access` and therefore covers all four DML commands) and the FORCE-RLS test at `:1285`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(api): register partner sending-domain tables in the RLS coverage contract

partner_sending_domains and partner_sender_identities join PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES
(shape 3); email_provider_domain_releases joins INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED. No org
cascade, device, ticket-move, export-policy or org-merge registration applies —
none of the three has an org_id, device_id or ticket_id column.

## Task 3: Shared validators and DTO types

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/shared/src/validators/sendingDomains.ts`
- Create: `packages/shared/src/validators/sendingDomains.test.ts`
- Create: `packages/shared/src/types/sendingDomains.ts`
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/validators/index.ts` (add `export * from './sendingDomains';` beside the other leaf re-exports at `:23-30`)
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` (add `export * from './sendingDomains';` after `export * from './deviceFunction';` at `:817`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (the plan index's "Defined in W02" list, verbatim names):
  ```ts
  export const SENDING_DOMAIN_STATUSES: readonly ['provisioning','pending','verified','at_risk','failed','suspended','removing'];
  export const SENDING_DOMAIN_STATUS_REASONS: readonly ['provider_conflict','provider_rejected','quota_exhausted','dns_not_detected','dns_removed','platform_suspended','abuse_auto','failed_expired','user_removed'];
  export const PARTNER_MAIL_STREAMS: readonly ['support','billing','general'];
  export type SendingDomainStatusValue = (typeof SENDING_DOMAIN_STATUSES)[number];
  export type SendingDomainStatusReason = (typeof SENDING_DOMAIN_STATUS_REASONS)[number];
  export type PartnerMailStreamValue = (typeof PARTNER_MAIL_STREAMS)[number];
  export type SendingDomainRejection =
    | 'empty' | 'scheme' | 'path' | 'port' | 'at_sign' | 'wildcard' | 'ip_literal'
    | 'too_few_labels' | 'label_length' | 'label_charset' | 'too_long' | 'numeric_tld' | 'idn_invalid';
  export type NormalizeSendingDomainResult =
    | { ok: true; domain: string }
    | { ok: false; reason: SendingDomainRejection };
  export function normalizeSendingDomain(input: string): NormalizeSendingDomainResult;
  export const RESERVED_SENDER_LOCAL_PARTS: readonly ['postmaster','abuse','mailer-daemon'];
  export const senderLocalPartSchema: z.ZodType<string, z.ZodTypeDef, string>;
  export const senderDisplayNameSchema: z.ZodType<string, z.ZodTypeDef, string>;
  export const createSendingDomainSchema: z.ZodType<{ domain: string }, z.ZodTypeDef, { domain: string }>;
  export const upsertSenderIdentitySchema: z.ZodType<{ sendingDomainId: string; localPart: string; displayName?: string | null; replyTo?: string | null }, …>;
  ```
  and the DTOs `SendingDomainDnsRecordDto`, `SendingDomainDto`, `SenderIdentityDto`, `SendingDomainsCapabilityDto`, `SendingDomainsListResponse`.
  Fields W05 depends on and that must stay **required** (not optional, not
  nullable): `SendingDomainDto.statusChangedAt` (the 72 h retry window on a
  `failed` row), `SenderIdentityDto.domain` and `SenderIdentityDto.fromAddress`
  (the identity card renders the exact From without re-joining). All three are
  declared required below and pinned by the DTO-shape test in Step 1.
- Consumes: `zod`, the WHATWG `URL` global (identical in Node 22 and every shipped browser).

git commit -m "feat(shared): sending-domain normalisation, identity schemas and DTOs

normalizeSendingDomain does the platform-independent half of spec §4.1 (trim,
lowercase, trailing dot, IDN->A-label via WHATWG URL, structural rejections) so
the web form and the API agree exactly. Identity rules per §4.4. DTOs are the
contract W05's settings tab is built against.

## Task 4: API-only domain policy (`assertSendingDomainAllowed`)

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/package.json` (add the `tldts` dependency — see Step 1)
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type SendingDomainPolicyRejection = 'platform_domain' | 'consumer_domain' | 'public_suffix' | 'denylisted';
  export class SendingDomainPolicyError extends Error { readonly reason: SendingDomainPolicyRejection }
  export function assertSendingDomainAllowed(domain: string): void;   // throws SendingDomainPolicyError
  export const PLATFORM_OWNED_DOMAINS: readonly ['2breeze.app', 'breezermm.com', 'lanternops.io'];
  ```
- Consumes: `isConsumerEmailDomain` (`services/consumerEmailDomains.ts:79` — takes an **email address**, so it is called as `isConsumerEmailDomain('postmaster@' + domain)`), `isHosted` (`config/env.ts:321`), `getEmailDomainsConfig().denylist` (Task 5 — this task lands first, so read `process.env.EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST` directly here and leave a `TODO(W02 Task 5)`-free direct read; Task 5's config module re-exposes the same parse and this module switches to it in Task 5 Step 5).
- Callers: W03's `createSendingDomain`. Input is always an **already normalised** domain from `normalizeSendingDomain`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the dependency**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm --filter @breeze/api add tldts
```
Expected: `apps/api/package.json` gains `"tldts": "^<resolved>"` in `dependencies`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` updates. Do **not** hand-edit the version — let pnpm resolve it, and commit the lockfile change with this task.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

## Task 5: Configuration — schema, boot rules, reader, documentation, compose

Ten optional variables (spec §11). **Every one is optional; none is ever
required by an upgrade.** Validation fails only on a contradiction the operator
introduced (`resend` with no key, `fake` in production) or a hosted-only rule
(`static` on hosted, identical keys on hosted).

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts` — zod keys after the email block (`:809`); a production `requireIf` after the last email `requireIf` (`:1712`); an unconditional deployment-mode block immediately before the `});` that closes the `.superRefine(...)` callback (after the APNS block, `~:2168`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/config/validate.test.ts` — new cases after the email H-3 block (`:2162`), before the Cloudflare comment (`:2164`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts` — an `EMAIL_DOMAINS_*` pin describe, copying the QBO template (`:260-289`)
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/config.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/config.test.ts`
- Modify: `.env.example` (append after `MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS=120000`, `:348`)
- Modify: `deploy/.env.example` (append after `# SMTP_PASS=`, `:247`)
- Modify: `docker-compose.yml` (insert after `MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS: ${MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS:-}`, `:420`)
- Modify: `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` (insert after `MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS: ${MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS:-}`, `:137`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.ts` (switch the denylist read to the config module — Step 6)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type EmailDomainsProviderId = 'resend' | 'static' | 'fake';
  export interface StaticAllowedEntry { domain: string; partnerSlug: string | null }
  export interface EmailDomainsConfig {
    provider: EmailDomainsProviderId | null;
    resendApiKey: string | null;
    resendSendingKey: string | null;   // falls back to resendApiKey
    region: string;
    maxPerPartner: number;
    dailySendCap: number;              // 0 = unlimited
    partnerAllowlist: string[];
    denylist: string[];
    staticAllowed: StaticAllowedEntry[];
    webhookSecret: string | null;
  }
  export function getEmailDomainsConfig(): EmailDomainsConfig;
  export function isPartnerLaneConfigured(): boolean;
  export function findStaticAllowedEntry(domain: string, partnerSlug: string | null): StaticAllowedEntry | null;
  ```
- Consumes: `isHosted` (`config/env.ts:321`).
- Callers: `providerRegistry.ts` (Task 6), all three adapters (Tasks 7-8),
  `domainPolicy.ts` (Step 6), W03's service and worker.

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/config/validate.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL on the `ENV_SCHEMA_KEYS` cases and the refusal cases.

- [ ] **Step 2: Declare the keys**

In `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts`, immediately after the existing email block
(`:809`, after `MAILGUN_DOMAIN: z.string().optional(),`):

```ts
    // -- Partner sending domains (spec 2026-09-17) ---------------------------
    // ALL optional, and none is ever required by an upgrade. Declared as plain
    // strings (not z.enum): compose maps optional vars as ${VAR:-}, so an unset
    // variable arrives as "" and a bare enum would refuse boot on every
    // deployment that upgrades. Value checks live in the superRefine, where ""
    // and unset both mean "the feature is off".
    EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER: z.string().optional(),
    EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED: z.string().optional(),
    EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY: z.string().optional(),
    EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY: z.string().optional(),

    EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST: z.string().optional(),
    EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET: z.string().optional(),
```

- [ ] **Step 3: The production requirement**

In the same file, immediately after the last email `requireIf` (the
`MAILGUN_DOMAIN` one ending at `:1712`), still inside the `if (isProduction) {`
block that opened at `:1210`:

```ts
      // Partner sending domains. KEYED ON EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER ONLY — never
      // on EMAIL_PROVIDER. A requireIf(EMAIL_PROVIDER === 'resend', …) here
      // would refuse boot on every Resend self-host that upgrades, which is the
      // exact promise spec §11 makes.
      const emailDomainsProviderProd = (data.EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER ?? '').trim().toLowerCase();
      requireIf(
        emailDomainsProviderProd === 'resend',

        data.EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY,
        'EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=resend (a full_access key; a sending-only key cannot manage domains)',
        ctx,
      );
      if (emailDomainsProviderProd === 'fake') {
        ctx.addIssue({
          code: z.ZodIssueCode.custom,
          path: ['EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER'],
          message:
            'EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake is refused in production. The fake provider verifies domains deterministically and sends nothing real; it exists for unit, integration, E2E and wt-stack runs only. Use `resend`, `static`, or leave it unset.',
        });
      }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The unconditional deployment-mode rules**

In the same file, immediately **before** the `});` that closes the
`.superRefine((data, ctx) => { … })` callback (after the APNS block, `~:2168`):

```ts
    // --- Partner sending domains: deployment-mode rules (spec §2.1, §11) ----
    // Outside the isProduction block on purpose: a hosted staging instance must
    // refuse `static` and identical keys exactly as production does, and an
    // unrecognised provider value is a misconfiguration in any NODE_ENV.
    const emailDomainsProvider = (data.EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER ?? '').trim().toLowerCase();
    if (emailDomainsProvider !== '') {
      const hostedInstance = ['true', '1', 'yes', 'on'].includes((data.IS_HOSTED ?? '').trim().toLowerCase());
      if (!['resend', 'static', 'fake'].includes(emailDomainsProvider)) {

        });
      }
      if (emailDomainsProvider === 'static' && hostedInstance) {
        ctx.addIssue({

        });
      }
      if (emailDomainsProvider === 'resend') {
        const platformKey = (data.RESEND_API_KEY ?? '').trim();
        const partnerKey = (data.EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY ?? '').trim();

- [ ] **Step 6: Document and map the variables**

Append to `.env.example` after `MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS=120000` (`:348`):

```
# --------------------------------------------
# Custom sender addresses / partner sending domains (optional)
# --------------------------------------------
# OFF by default. With EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER unset nothing changes: the
# settings tab is hidden, the routes 404, the worker is not registered, and
# every email is sent exactly as before. Upgrading never requires any of these.
#
# EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER picks HOW a sending domain is proven:
#   - unset  : feature off (default).
#   - static : you attest that this instance's mail relay may send as the
#              domains you list below. Use this on SMTP or Mailgun, where there
#              is no domain API for Breeze to check. SPF/DKIM for those domains
#              are YOUR mail setup; Breeze cannot verify them. A domain becomes
#              usable once a test send from it is accepted by the relay.
#   - resend : Breeze creates the domain in your Resend account and shows the
#              DKIM/SPF records to publish. Needs a full_access key — a
#              sending-only key cannot manage domains.
#   - fake   : deterministic test double. Refused in production.
#
# NOTE: this is the domain Breeze SENDS AS, which is not TICKETS_INBOUND_DOMAIN
# (what Breeze RECEIVES on) and not MAILGUN_DOMAIN.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=
# `static` only. Comma-separated `domain` or `domain:partner-slug`. An unbound
# entry may be claimed by any partner on this instance, which is right for a
# single-partner install.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED=
# `resend` only. full_access key of the account that holds partner domains. One
# account for both lanes is fine self-hosted; the trade-off is that partner
# domains then share your platform mail's sending reputation.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY=
# Optional sending_access key of the same account, so the send path never holds
# the management key. Falls back to EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY=
# Resend region for newly created domains: us-east-1, eu-west-1, sa-east-1, ap-northeast-1.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION=us-east-1
# Sending domains one partner may hold.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER=3
# Partner-lane messages per partner per UTC day. 0 = unlimited (the self-hosted
# default). Over the cap a message goes out from EMAIL_FROM as it would today.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP=0
# Comma-separated partner ids. Empty means every eligible partner.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST=
# Extra domains nobody on this instance may add, comma-separated.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST=
# Delivery-webhook signing secret. Unset leaves the endpoint inert.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Append to `deploy/.env.example` after `# SMTP_PASS=` (`:247`):

```
# ── Custom sender addresses (optional; off unless EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER is set) ──
# Hosted uses `resend` with a SEPARATE Resend team from RESEND_API_KEY — Resend
# enforces bounce/spam limits account-wide, so partner-domain mail must not
# share the account that carries password resets. `static` is refused when
# IS_HOSTED=true.
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION=us-east-1
EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER=3
EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP=2000
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED=
EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Insert into `docker-compose.yml`'s `x-api-env: &api-env` anchor after
`MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS: ${MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS:-}` (`:420`), before the inbound
comment at `:421`:

```yaml
  # Custom sender addresses / partner sending domains. All optional; unset =
  # feature off. Compose interpolation only happens for vars listed here, so a
  # value in .env alone is inert.
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET:-}
```

Insert the identical ten lines into `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`'s
`x-api-env: &api-env` anchor after `MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS: ${MAILGUN_TIMEOUT_MS:-}`
(`:137`), before `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (`:138`). One insertion covers both the
`api` service (`<<: *api-env`, `:462`) and the `worker` service (`:520`).

- [ ] **Step 7: Pin the plumbing**

Add to `apps/api/src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts`, after the QuickBooks
describe (`:289`), copying its four-axis template:

```ts
/**
 * Partner sending domains (spec 2026-09-17 §11). Pinned on all four axes for
 * the same reason QBO_* is: a variable that validate.ts accepts but that no
 * compose file maps is a silent no-op — setting it in .env does nothing and the
 * feature just stays dark, which is indistinguishable from "not configured yet".
 */
describe('EMAIL_DOMAINS_* env plumbing (partner sending domains W02)', () => {
  const ROOT_COMPOSE = readFileSync(path.join(REPO_ROOT, 'docker-compose.yml'), 'utf8');
  const PROD_COMPOSE = readFileSync(path.join(REPO_ROOT, 'deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml'), 'utf8');
  const EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS = [
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST',
    'EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET',
  ] as const;

  it.each(EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS)('%s is declared in the validate.ts schema', (name) => {
    expect(ENV_SCHEMA_KEYS).toContain(name);
  });

  it.each(EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS)('%s is documented in the root .env.example', (name) => {
    expect(documentedEnvExampleVars('.env.example')).toContain(name);
  });

  it.each(EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS)('%s is documented in deploy/.env.example', (name) => {
    expect(documentedEnvExampleVars('deploy/.env.example')).toContain(name);
  });

  it.each(EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS)('%s reaches the api container in docker-compose.yml', (name) => {
    expect(isReferencedInCompose(name, ROOT_COMPOSE)).toBe(true);
  });

  it.each(EMAIL_DOMAINS_VARS)('%s reaches the api container in deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml', (name) => {
    expect(isReferencedInCompose(name, PROD_COMPOSE)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run everything and commit**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run src/config/validate.test.ts src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts src/config/composeBindMounts.test.ts src/services/emailDomains/config.test.ts src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.test.ts
```
Expected: all PASS. `composeBindMounts.test.ts` is unaffected (it walks
`services[*].volumes`, never `environment:`) — run it anyway to prove the
compose edits did not break YAML parsing.

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/config/validate.ts apps/api/src/config/validate.test.ts apps/api/src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/config.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/config.test.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.ts .env.example deploy/.env.example docker-compose.yml deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml
git commit -m "feat(api): EMAIL_DOMAINS_* configuration, boot rules and compose plumbing

Ten optional variables (spec §11). Every requireIf is keyed on
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER, never on EMAIL_PROVIDER, so a Resend self-host that
upgrades is never asked for a partner-lane key. fake is refused in production,
static when IS_HOSTED=true, and an EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY identical to
RESEND_API_KEY when hosted — self-hosted gets one informational line instead.
Mapped in BOTH compose files; envComposeParity pins all four axes.

## Task 6: Provider interface and registry

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/provider.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: spec §5's types verbatim (`SendingDomainStatus`, `ProviderDnsRecord`,
  `ProviderDomain`, `PartnerLaneSendError`, `EmailDomainProvider`), plus
  `PartnerLaneMessage = RawEmailMessage`,
  `class PartnerLaneSendFailure extends Error { readonly error: PartnerLaneSendError }`,
  `class ProviderDomainConflictError`, `class ProviderDomainRejectedError`,
  `getEmailDomainProvider(): EmailDomainProvider | null`,
  `resetEmailDomainProviderForTests(): void`.
- Consumes: `RawEmailMessage` and `PartnerMailStream` from **W01** (`services/email.ts`,
  `services/emailDomains/mailPurposes.ts`), `getEmailDomainsConfig()` (Task 5),
  the three adapter factories (Tasks 7-8 — write this task's registry with the
  imports in place and implement the adapters next; the registry test is skipped
  until then, see Step 3).
- **Explicitly NOT produced here:** the find-then-create classification of spec
  §5.1 (the four cases: nothing found → create; found with a provider
  `createdAt` newer than `provision_attempted_at` → ours from a crashed attempt;
  found and older → pre-existing, `provider_managed = false`; ambiguous →
  not managed). That is **orchestration, and W03's `syncSendingDomain` performs
  it** using `findDomainByName`, `createDomain` and `ProviderDomain.createdAt`.
  W02's only obligation is that the adapter methods return what that logic
  needs: `findDomainByName` returns `null` when the provider has no such domain
  and a `ProviderDomain` with a populated `createdAt` when it does (or
  `createdAt: undefined` when the provider does not report one, which W03 must
  treat as the ambiguous case → `provider_managed = false`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `provider.ts`**

```ts
import type { RawEmailMessage } from '../email';
import type { PartnerMailStream } from './mailPurposes';
import { PARTNER_MAIL_STREAMS } from '@breeze/shared';

/**
 * Provider-neutral sending-domain interface (spec §5).
 *
 * Adapters are PURE with respect to Breeze's database: they never read or write
 * a table. They take what they need as arguments and return provider facts.
 * Orchestration — which row moves to which status, when to create versus adopt
 * — belongs to W03's syncSendingDomain.

This file does not compile until Tasks 7 and 8 land the three adapter modules.
Write it now, leave the test red on the missing adapter imports, and turn it
green at the end of Task 8.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit the interface**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/provider.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): EmailDomainProvider interface and provider registry

Spec §5 types verbatim, plus PartnerLaneMessage = RawEmailMessage and the
PartnerLaneSendFailure carrier class (plan index amendment 3). The registry
returns null when EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER is unset — the one switch that keeps
this wave dark. Adapters land in the next two commits.

## Task 7: The `resend` adapter

Written against the **installed** SDK, `resend@6.18.0` (`apps/api/package.json:101`
declares `^6.18.0`; `pnpm-lock.yaml:10605` pins `resend@6.18.0`). Facts taken
from `node_modules/resend/dist/index.d.mts` and verified before writing:

- `domains.create(payload: CreateDomainOptions)` takes **camelCase**
  `{ name, region?, customReturnPath?, … }` (`:1281-1290`). The snake_case
  `custom_return_path` is the internal wire type (`DomainApiOptions`, `:108-118`)
  and must **not** be passed.
- `DomainRegion = 'us-east-1' | 'eu-west-1' | 'sa-east-1' | 'ap-northeast-1'` (`:38`).
- `DomainStatus = 'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed' | 'not_started' | 'partially_verified' | 'partially_failed'` (`:94`) — **no `temporary_failure`** at domain level in this SDK version, though the API returns it (plan amendment 8).
- Records are a discriminated union on `record`: `'SPF' | 'DKIM' | 'Receiving' | 'Tracking' | 'TrackingCAA'`, with `type` `'MX'|'TXT'|'CNAME'|'CAA'`, `ttl: string` (not a number) and `priority` required only on `Receiving` (`:45-92`).
- `domains.verify(id)` returns **only the id** (`VerifyDomainsResponseSuccess`, `:1336-1339`) — it does not return the updated status, so a caller that needs one follows with `getDomain`.
- `domains.list()` returns `{ data: { data: Domain[], object, has_more } }` and the per-domain rows carry **no `records[]`** (`:1306-1313`, `:96-106`).
- The SDK **returns** errors, it never throws (except `new Resend(undefined)`): every call resolves to `{ data, error, headers }` with `ErrorResponse = { message: string; statusCode: number | null; name: RESEND_ERROR_CODE_KEY }` (`:120-139`). A network failure yields `statusCode: null` with `name: 'application_error'`, which is **indistinguishable by name** from a server 5xx — so the classifier keys on `statusCode` too.

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/resend.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/resendSendErrorFixtures.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/resend.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `createResendDomainProvider(): EmailDomainProvider`,
  `mapResendDomainStatus(raw: string): ProviderDomain['state']`,
  `normalizeResendRecords(domain: string, records: unknown[]): ProviderDnsRecord[]`,
  `classifyResendSendError(error: { name: string; statusCode: number | null; message: string }): PartnerLaneSendError`,
  `RESEND_SEND_ERROR_FIXTURES`.
- Consumes: `Resend` (`resend`), `getEmailDomainsConfig()` (Task 5), the Task 6 types.

git commit -m "feat(api): Resend sending-domain adapter

Written against resend@6.18.0's real types: camelCase createDomain payload, the
six-member DomainStatus union plus the temporary_failure the API returns but the
SDK type omits, ttl as a string, and the {data,error} envelope the SDK returns
instead of throwing. Send errors classify into the four spec §5 kinds with
ambiguous as the conservative default; the domain-refusal check runs before the
validation_error rule so a not-verified refusal falls back rather than being
lost. Recorded fixtures are the W03 lab step's refresh target.

## Task 8: The `static` and `fake` adapters

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/fake.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `createStaticDomainProvider(): EmailDomainProvider`,
  `classifyPlatformTransportError(err: unknown): PartnerLaneSendError`,
  `createFakeDomainProvider(): EmailDomainProvider`,
  `resetFakeDomainProviderState(): void`, `FAKE_PREEXISTING_PREFIX`.
- Consumes: `getEmailService()` (`services/email.ts:409`, returns
  `EmailService | null`) and its **W01** method
  `deliverRaw(message: RawEmailMessage): Promise<void>`;
  `findStaticAllowedEntry` / `getEmailDomainsConfig` (Task 5); Task 6's types.
- Contract notes for W03, restated because W02 owns them:
  - `static.verifiesByDns === false`, so W03 must never call
    `requestVerification` on it and must treat a `pending` result from
    `getDomain`/`findDomainByName` as **no change** — a `verified` static row
    stays verified. The adapter only ever reports `pending` (still listed) or
    `failed` (delisted by the operator, spec §13).
  - `static.getDomain(key)` takes the **domain name**, not a provider id
    (plan amendment 5).

**Simplify `isListed` before committing:** the `require(...)` above is a
placeholder for the ESM import. Replace the two helpers with a single one that
imports `getEmailDomainsConfig` at the top of the file:

```ts
import { findStaticAllowedEntry, getEmailDomainsConfig } from '../config';

/**
 * Whether the operator still lists this NAME. The partner binding is enforced
 * at create; a re-check only asks whether the domain is still allowed at all,
 * so a bound entry re-checks true without the caller carrying a slug.
 */
function isStillListed(domain: string): boolean {
  const target = domain.trim().toLowerCase().replace(/\.+$/, '');
  return getEmailDomainsConfig().staticAllowed.some((entry) => entry.domain === target);
}
```

and use `isStillListed` in `findDomainByName` and `getDomain`. Delete the inner
`isListed`/`rawListed` closures entirely.

  type CreateProviderDomainInput,
  type EmailDomainProvider,
  type PartnerLaneMessage,
  type ProviderDnsRecord,
  type ProviderDomain
} from '../provider';

/**
 * Deterministic provider for unit, integration, E2E and wt-stack runs (spec
 * §5.1). Refused in production by config/validate.ts.
 *
 * Behaviour is keyed on the DOMAIN NAME so a test needs no setup:
 *   *.verify.test     -> verifies on the first check
 *   *.fail.test       -> fails verification, and refuses to send (domain_unusable)
 *   conflict.test     -> createDomain raises ProviderDomainConflictError
 *   preexisting.*     -> findDomainByName reports an ALREADY VERIFIED domain
 *                        created in the year 2000, which drives spec §5.1
 *                        case 4 (adopt with provider_managed = false)
 *   anything else     -> stays pending
 *
 * `send` hands the message to the platform transport verbatim, so a local
 * Mailpit shows the custom From.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, including the registry test that was left red in Task 6**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.test.ts src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.test.ts
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
```
Expected: all PASS; no type errors. `providerRegistry.test.ts` is green now that all three adapter modules exist.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.test.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/fake.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): static and fake sending-domain adapters

static is the self-hosted operator attestation (spec D7): no external calls, an
allow-list check with an optional partner-slug binding, and sends through the
platform transport with a custom From. Its send-error classifier puts
sender-refusal text ahead of the bare SMTP code, so a 550 5.7.60 SendAs refusal
falls back to EMAIL_FROM instead of losing the message. fake is deterministic on
the domain name, including a preexisting.* prefix that drives the adopt-and-never-
delete case W03 has to get right.

## Task 9: The adapter contract suite

One suite, three adapters. It asserts the properties every adapter must hold
whatever it talks to, so a fourth adapter (SES) inherits the test for free.

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/adapters/adapterContract.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: all three factories, `resetFakeDomainProviderState`, the Task 6 types.
- Produces: nothing importable.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and commit**

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/adapters/adapterContract.test.ts` → all PASS.

git commit -m "test(api): one EmailDomainProvider contract suite over fake, static and mocked resend

Properties every adapter must hold whatever it talks to: the declared id and
verifiesByDns, a consumable ProviderDomain, fqdn on every record, null for an
unheld name, 404-as-success on delete, and a PartnerLaneSendFailure carrying one
of the four kinds rather than a bare Error. Plus the find-then-create inputs
W03's orchestration reads.

## Task 10: The `custom_sending_domain` capability

`GatedCapability` appears in **exactly one** API file and has **no**
`Record<GatedCapability, …>`, mapped type, capability array or `never`
exhaustiveness check anywhere in `apps/`, `packages/` or `ee/`. The web keeps
its own copy of the union, and that copy **does** have an exhaustive record —
which is the only compile error the change produces.

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.ts:10` (the single-line union)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts:242` (the `it.each` tuple)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/lib/trustProbation.ts:4-8` (union) and `:19-24` (runtime `Set`)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/trust/TrustProbationBanner.tsx:30-35` (`CAPABILITY_LABELS`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `GatedCapability` gains `'custom_sending_domain'`; `requireCapability('custom_sending_domain')` becomes available to W03's write routes, and `evaluateCapabilityContinuationForState('custom_sending_domain', …)` to W04's `resolveSender`.
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Verified behaviour (`partnerTrust.ts:200-223`): `decide` has a `default:` branch at `:220-221` and no exhaustiveness check, so the new value takes the default branch with **no** forced API compile error. `trusted` short-circuits to allow at `:205`; `probation` denies `TRUST_PROBATION`/`probation_default_deny`; `restricted` denies `TRUST_RESTRICTED`/**`restricted`** (a different reason string — do not assert one reason for both); `partnerTrustMode() === 'off'` returns `{ allow: true }` at `:226-227` before the partner row is even read, and `partnerTrustMode()` returns `'off'` whenever `!isHosted()` (`config/partnerTrustMode.ts:12`), so on self-hosted the gate is open with no configuration.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts`, extend the `it.each` tuple at
`:242` and add three cases after that block:

```ts
  it.each(['remote_control', 'device_execute', 'installer_distribute', 'custom_sending_domain'] as const)(
    'denies %s in probation',
    async (cap) => {
      const d = await evaluateCapability(cap, { partnerId: 'p1' });
      expect(d).toMatchObject({ allow: false, code: 'TRUST_PROBATION', capability: cap });
      expect(audit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({
        action: 'partner.trust.capability_denied',
      }));
    },
  );

  it('denies custom_sending_domain for a restricted partner with reason "restricted"', async () => {
    state.trustState = 'restricted';
    const d = await evaluateCapability('custom_sending_domain', { partnerId: 'p1' });
    expect(d).toMatchObject({ allow: false, code: 'TRUST_RESTRICTED', reason: 'restricted' });
  });

  it('allows custom_sending_domain for a trusted partner and writes no audit row', async () => {
    state.trustState = 'trusted';
    expect(await evaluateCapability('custom_sending_domain', { partnerId: 'p1' })).toEqual({ allow: true });
    expect(audit).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it('allows custom_sending_domain in off mode without reading the partner row — the self-hosted path', async () => {
    vi.mocked(partnerTrustMode).mockReturnValue('off');
    state.trustState = 'probation';
    expect(await evaluateCapability('custom_sending_domain', { partnerId: 'p1' })).toEqual({ allow: true });
    expect(audit).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
```

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `'custom_sending_domain'` is not assignable to `GatedCapability`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Widen the API union**

`apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.ts:10` — append the new value last, matching
the file's historical add-at-the-end order (the union is not alphabetised):

```ts
export type GatedCapability = 'remote_control' | 'device_execute' | 'installer_distribute' | 'agent_enroll' | 'custom_sending_domain';
```

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts` → PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mirror it in the web, in all three places**

`apps/web/src/lib/trustProbation.ts` — the union at `:4-8` (one member per line,
same order as the API):

```ts
export type TrustCapability =
  | 'remote_control'
  | 'device_execute'
  | 'installer_distribute'
  | 'agent_enroll'
  | 'custom_sending_domain';
```

and the runtime `Set` at `:19-24` — **this is the dangerous one**: `isTrustDenial`
returns `false` for an unrecognised capability, so a 403 would fall through to a
generic error toast and the trust banner would never appear. No compiler catches
it.

```ts
const TRUST_CAPABILITIES = new Set<TrustCapability>([
  'remote_control',
  'device_execute',
  'installer_distribute',
  'agent_enroll',
  'custom_sending_domain',
]);
```

`apps/web/src/components/trust/TrustProbationBanner.tsx:30-35` — this
`Record<TrustDenial['capability'], string>` is exhaustive, so widening the union
without this edit is a TS2741 missing-property error. It is read at `:115` with
no fallback, so a missing key renders "undefined is temporarily unavailable."

```ts
const CAPABILITY_LABELS: Record<TrustDenial['capability'], string> = {
  remote_control: 'Remote control',
  device_execute: 'Script execution',
  installer_distribute: 'Installer distribution',
  agent_enroll: 'Agent enrollment',
  custom_sending_domain: 'Custom sending domain',
};
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Typecheck the web and commit**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx astro check
npx vitest run src/lib src/components/trust
```
Expected: no type errors; web tests PASS.

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.ts apps/api/src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts apps/web/src/lib/trustProbation.ts apps/web/src/components/trust/TrustProbationBanner.tsx
git commit -m "feat(api,web): custom_sending_domain gated capability

Takes partnerTrust.decide's default branch: denied on probation and restricted,
allowed for trusted, and open with no configuration self-hosted because
partnerTrustMode() returns off whenever !isHosted(). The web mirror needs all
three edits — the union, the runtime Set that isTrustDenial checks (silent
failure, no compiler), and the exhaustive label record (compile error).

## Task 11: The provider-release path and its two hooks

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts` (import after `:52`; call inside `cascadeDeletePartner` between the `purge_started` audit that ends at `:1609` and the child-org lookup that starts at `:1611`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/tenantOffboarding.ts` (import after `:30`; call inside `finalizePartnerOffboarding` immediately after `if (flipped.length === 0) return null;` at `:1025`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` (`ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `releaseSendingDomainsForPartner(partnerId: string): Promise<number>` — returns the number of rows whose `provider_domain_id` it nulled. **No provider calls**: it only writes the outbox and clears the local handle, so it is safe inside a destructive path that must not depend on a third party being up.
- Consumes: `db`, `withSystemDbAccessContext`, `getCurrentDbAccessContext` (`db/index.ts:650, 742, 933`), `partnerSendingDomains`, `emailProviderDomainReleases` (Task 1).

**DB-context handling — verified, and the reason the shape below is what it is:**

- `withDbAccessContext` **early-returns `fn()` when a context already exists**
  (`db/index.ts:654-656`). It joins; it does not nest a transaction. So
  `withSystemDbAccessContext` inside this function opens a fresh system
  transaction when there is no ambient context, and joins when there is one.
- `cascadeDeletePartner` has **no ambient context** — it wraps each statement in
  its own `withSystemDbAccessContext` and its comment at `:1619-1620` explicitly
  forbids an outer wrapper ("would nest transactions"). So this function opens
  its own, exactly like every other step there.
- `finalizePartnerOffboarding` **already runs inside** one:
  `sweepOffboardingTenants` calls it under
  `runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(async () => { … }))`
  (`tenantOffboarding.ts:1436-1458`). The inner `withSystemDbAccessContext` joins
  that transaction — no second pooled connection, no #1105 hold.
- `runOutsideDbContext` is **not** used here. It does not close the ambient
  transaction; it only silences the #1105 tripwire (memory
  `runoutsidedbcontext_does_not_close_outer_txn`), and the ambient context in
  both callers is already system scope, which is what this work needs.
- Because `withSystemDbAccessContext` joins whatever is ambient, a future caller
  inside a **request** context would silently run these writes under a
  partner/org scope and match zero rows. The function therefore asserts the
  ambient scope first and throws.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit test**

`apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';

```

Run: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — module not found.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement `domainRelease.ts`**

```ts
import { and, eq, isNotNull } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { db, getCurrentDbAccessContext, withSystemDbAccessContext } from '../../db';
import { emailProviderDomainReleases, partnerSendingDomains } from '../../db/schema';

/**
 * Release every provider-side sending domain a partner still owns (spec §3.5).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `partner_sending_domains` carries a BEFORE DELETE trigger
 * that raises while `provider_domain_id` is set, so any path that deletes a
 * partner's rows without releasing first aborts loudly instead of silently
 * leaking a domain in the provider account. This is the one function that
 * satisfies the guard, and it is called FIRST in both partner-destroying paths.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The outbox row is written BEFORE the handle is
 * nulled, so a crash between the two leaves a releasable outbox row rather than
 * an orphaned provider domain nobody can name any more. The outbox table
 * deliberately has no partner_id, so cascadeDeletePartner's sweep leaves it
 * standing.
 *
 * `provider_managed = false` rows get their handle cleared but NO outbox row:
 * that provider domain pre-existed Breeze asking for it and is very likely the
 * operator's primary sending domain. Leaking one is recoverable; deleting
 * someone's mail domain is not.
 *
 * NO PROVIDER CALLS. This runs inside destructive paths that must not depend on
 * a third party being reachable; the worker drains the outbox later.
 *
 * DB CONTEXT. `withSystemDbAccessContext` JOINS an existing context rather than
 * nesting (db/index.ts:654-656), which is exactly right for the two callers:
 * `cascadeDeletePartner` holds none and gets a fresh system transaction;
 * `finalizePartnerOffboarding` already runs inside one (sweepOffboardingTenants
 * wraps it) and this joins it — no second pooled connection. Because joining is
 * unconditional, a future caller inside a REQUEST context would run these
 * writes under a tenant scope and match zero rows, so the ambient scope is
 * asserted first.
 */
export async function releaseSendingDomainsForPartner(partnerId: string): Promise<number> {
  const ambient = getCurrentDbAccessContext();
  if (ambient && ambient.scope !== 'system') {
    throw new Error(
      `[emailDomains] releaseSendingDomainsForPartner must run in system scope; ambient scope is '${ambient.scope}'. ` +

    return released;
  }, 'emailDomains.releaseSendingDomainsForPartner');
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Hook `cascadeDeletePartner`**

`apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts` — add the import after
`import { deleteObjects } from './s3Storage';` (`:52`):

```ts
import { releaseSendingDomainsForPartner } from './emailDomains/domainRelease';
```

Then, inside `cascadeDeletePartner`, between the closing `});` of the
`purge_started` `createAuditLog` call (`:1609`) and the `// Lookup child orgs …`
comment (`:1611`):

```ts
  // Release provider-side sending domains BEFORE any delete (spec §3.5).
  // partner_sending_domains carries a BEFORE DELETE guard that raises while the
  // row still owns a provider_domain_id, so the partner-axis sweep below would
  // abort the purge without this. It writes an email_provider_domain_releases
  // row for every provider_managed domain — that table has no partner_id, so it
  // survives the sweep and the worker drains it afterwards — and never one for
  // a domain Breeze did not create. No provider call is made here.
  //
  // It runs after the forensic breadcrumb above on purpose: the purge_started
  // audit must exist even if this step throws. It opens its own system context,
  // like every other statement in this function (see the nesting warning below).
  await releaseSendingDomainsForPartner(partnerId);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Hook `finalizePartnerOffboarding`**

`apps/api/src/services/tenantOffboarding.ts` — add the import after
`import { getEmailService } from './email';` (`:30`):

```ts
import { releaseSendingDomainsForPartner } from './emailDomains/domainRelease';
```

Then, inside `finalizePartnerOffboarding`, immediately after
`if (flipped.length === 0) return null;` (`:1025`):

```ts
  // Release provider-side sending domains (spec §3.5). Placed AFTER the status
  // CAS so a lost race — another sweep already flipped this partner — cannot
  // release domains for a partner that is no longer offboarding. This function
  // already runs inside runOutsideDbContext(() => withSystemDbAccessContext(…))
  // from sweepOffboardingTenants, and withSystemDbAccessContext JOINS an
  // existing context rather than nesting, so no second pooled connection is
  // taken. Makes no provider call.
  await releaseSendingDomainsForPartner(partnerId);
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Register `domainRelease.ts` in the partner-wide write allowlist**

`apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` — add to
`ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`, before the closing `};` after the
`services/orgArchive.ts` entry:

```ts
  // --- partner sending domains (spec 2026-09-17 W02) -----------------------
  'services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts': 'releaseSendingDomainsForPartner has no caller-facing surface at all: it is invoked only by cascadeDeletePartner and finalizePartnerOffboarding, both of which run in system context on a partner already being destroyed, and it takes the partner id from those functions rather than from any request. It writes exactly two things — an outbox row and provider_domain_id = NULL — and creates no partner-owned configuration, so there is no partner-wide policy decision for canManagePartnerWidePolicies to gate.',
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run everything this task touches**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts src/services/tenantCascade
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
```
Expected: all PASS (`partner-wide-write-coverage` proves both that the new write
site is accounted for and that the entry is not stale); no type errors.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.ts apps/api/src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/services/tenantOffboarding.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(api): release provider sending domains on partner cascade and offboarding

releaseSendingDomainsForPartner writes an outbox row for every provider_managed
domain and then nulls provider_domain_id, in that order, so a crash between the
two leaves releasable work rather than an unnameable provider domain. It makes
no provider call and never writes an outbox row for a domain Breeze did not
create. Wired first into cascadeDeletePartner and finalizePartnerOffboarding —
without it the BEFORE DELETE guard aborts the partner purge. Registered in
partner-wide-write-coverage's allowlist, which the spec's §3.5 list missed.

## Task 12: Live-Postgres contract suite

**Placement rule:** the file must live in `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/`.
`vitest.integration.config.ts`'s include list covers
`src/__tests__/integration/**/*.test.ts`; a co-located `*.integration.test.ts`
anywhere else runs in **no CI job at all** unless it is named explicitly in that
list. The harness idiom below is copied from
`aiScriptPoliciesPartnerRls.integration.test.ts:18-105`.

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `db`, `withDbAccessContext`, `type DbAccessContext` (`../../db`), the
  Task 1 Drizzle tables, `releaseSendingDomainsForPartner` (Task 11),
  `cascadeDeletePartner` (`../../services/tenantCascade`), `pgErrorCode`
  (`../../utils/pgErrors`), `createOrganization` / `createPartner` (`./db-utils`).
- Produces: nothing importable.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the suite**

```ts
/**
 * partner_sending_domains / partner_sender_identities / email_provider_domain_releases
 * — live RLS, uniqueness, the tenant-consistent composite FK, the BEFORE DELETE
 * release guard, and the partner-cascade path (spec §3, §14; CLAUDE.md "Tenant
 * Isolation" step 6).
 *
 * The shipped policies (2026-10-20-100000-partner-sending-domains.sql) are:
 *   partner_sending_domains_partner_access     FOR ALL  system OR breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id)
 *   partner_sender_identities_partner_access   FOR ALL  system OR breeze_has_partner_access(partner_id)
 *   email_provider_domain_releases_system_only FOR ALL  breeze.scope = 'system'
 *
 * rls-coverage.integration.test.ts proves the policies EXIST by reading
 * pg_catalog; it cannot prove either enforces anything. This suite drives the
 * real postgres.js driver as `breeze_app` under FORCE RLS, which is the only
 * thing that does.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run (the stack from Task 1 Step 5 must be up):
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts
```
Expected: every case RUNS and PASSES. Check the reported test count — a suite in
the wrong directory reports zero tests and still exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/partnerSendingDomainsRls.integration.test.ts
git commit -m "test(api): live-Postgres contract suite for partner sending domains

Cross-partner forge (42501), org-scope zero rows, UNIQUE(domain) across
partners, the composite FK refusing a cross-partner identity, the BEFORE DELETE
release guard raising and then allowing, an outbox that is invisible outside
system scope and carries no partner_id, releaseSendingDomainsForPartner writing
outbox rows only for provider_managed domains, and cascadeDeletePartner
succeeding on a partner with live domains while leaving the outbox row standing.

## Task 13: Verification

Everything below must pass before the PR. Nothing here changes code.

- [ ] **Step 1: Typecheck every package this wave touched**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web && npx astro check
```
Expected: no errors anywhere.

- [ ] **Step 2: Every unit file this wave added or changed**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/packages/shared
npx vitest run src/validators/sendingDomains.test.ts

cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api
npx vitest run \
  src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts \
  src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts \
  src/config/validate.test.ts \
  src/config/envComposeParity.test.ts \
  src/config/composeBindMounts.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/config.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/domainPolicy.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/providerRegistry.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/domainRelease.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/adapters/resend.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/adapters/static.test.ts \
  src/services/emailDomains/adapters/adapterContract.test.ts \
  src/services/partnerTrust.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts

cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib src/components/trust
```
Expected: all PASS. **Check the reported file count on each run** — vitest's
path filter is a plain substring match, so a typo silently scopes to zero files
and still exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 3: The full API unit suite**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/api && npx vitest run
```
Expected: PASS. This is the job (`Test API`) that catches the partner-wide-write
allowlist and the env-parity pins.

- [ ] **Step 4: Migration guards and drift**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
ls apps/api/migrations/*.sql | sort | tail -1
scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:check-drift
```
Expected: the migration still sorts last against `origin/main` (rename upward if
not — `origin/main` may have gained one since Task 1); the naming guard passes;
migrate is a no-op on the already-migrated stack; **no drift**.

- [ ] **Step 5: The contract suites**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain

Expected: all PASS. The org-cascade, export-policy and erasure-roundtrip suites
are listed to **prove the negative** claimed in Task 2 — that three tables with
no `org_id` need no entry in any of those registries. If one of them reds naming
a new table, the tenancy analysis is wrong and the PR stops here.

- [ ] **Step 6: The manual `breeze_app` forge (CLAUDE.md "Tenant Isolation" step 6)**

Find the test stack's Postgres container, then forge a cross-tenant insert by
hand — this is the check that does not depend on any test harness being correct:

```bash
docker compose ls -a --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.ConfigFiles|test("breeze")) | .Name'
docker exec -it <that project's postgres container> psql -U breeze_app -d breeze
```

```sql
-- No context at all: deny-by-default, zero rows.
SELECT count(*) FROM partner_sending_domains;

-- Forge a row for a partner this session has no access to.
SELECT set_config('breeze.scope', 'partner', false);
SELECT set_config('breeze.accessible_partner_ids', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ff', false);
INSERT INTO partner_sending_domains (partner_id, domain, provider)
VALUES ((SELECT id FROM partners LIMIT 1), 'forged.example', 'fake');
-- EXPECTED: ERROR: new row violates row-level security policy for table "partner_sending_domains"

-- The outbox is system-only.
SELECT count(*) FROM email_provider_domain_releases;
-- EXPECTED: 0 rows regardless of what system scope inserted.
```
Expected: the INSERT fails with `new row violates row-level security policy`,
and the outbox select returns 0.

- [ ] **Step 7: Tear the stack down and open the PR**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm test-stack down
docker compose ls -a --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.ConfigFiles|test("breeze")) | "\(.Name)\t\(.Status)"'
```
Expected: this worktree's test stack is gone. Say in the PR what, if anything,
was left running.

PR body must contain:
- `Closes #6182`
- the three new tables with their tenancy shape and the justification spec §3.1
  requires for a partner-axis (not org-XOR-partner) config table: the From
  domain is the MSP's identity, a per-org sending domain is the internal
  phishing shape, and an internal IT team is a partner with one org;
- the registrations made (`PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` ×2, `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` ×1,
  `ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK` ×1) **and** the registries deliberately not
  touched, with the reason (no `org_id`, no `device_id`, no `ticket_id`);
- the `## Plan amendments` list from the top of this document;
- that the wave lands dark: `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` unset changes nothing.

## Self-review

Every in-scope requirement, and the task that discharges it.

| # | Requirement (source) | Task |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Three tables with every column of spec §3.1, §3.2, §3.3 | 1 |
| 2 | CHECKs on the status, stream and provider value sets (+ status reason, test status, static-has-no-provider-id, lowercase domain, jsonb array) | 1 |
| 3 | `UNIQUE (domain)`, `UNIQUE (id, partner_id)`, `UNIQUE (partner_id, stream)`, `UNIQUE (provider, provider_domain_id)` | 1 |
| 4 | Composite FK `(sending_domain_id, partner_id) → partner_sending_domains(id, partner_id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, non-deferrable with the evidence for that call | 1 + amendment 6 |
| 5 | Indexes: `(partner_id)`, `(next_check_at)`, `(sending_domain_id)`, outbox due index | 1 |
| 6 | RLS enable + force + partner-axis policy from the `2026-09-25-time-entry-…` template; system-only policy on the outbox from the `abuse_script_hosts` precedent; `GRANT … DELETE` for the partner sweep | 1 |
| 7 | `BEFORE DELETE` release-guard trigger | 1 |
| 8 | Idempotent, no inner `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, DDL only (no `set_config` — confirmed against `migrationRlsScope.test.ts`) | 1 (Steps 2, 4) |
| 9 | Outbox has no `partner_id`; partner FKs carry no `ON DELETE CASCADE` | 1 (asserted live in 12) |
| 10 | Drizzle `emailSendingDomains.ts` + schema-index export; `pnpm db:check-drift` | 1 (Step 5), 13 (Step 4) |
| 11 | `PARTNER_TENANT_TABLES` ×2, `INTENTIONAL_UNSCOPED` ×1 | 2 |
| 12 | Verified that `cascadeDeletePartner` auto-discovers `partner_id` tables and that no org-cascade, device, ticket-move, export-policy or org-merge list applies — with the citations | 2 (table), 13 (Step 5 proves the negative) |
| 13 | The registration list the spec missed (`ALLOWED_WITHOUT_CAPABILITY_CHECK`) | amendment 3, registered in 11 |
| 14 | `normalizeSendingDomain` per §4.1 shared half, table-driven with complete case lists | 3 |
| 15 | Identity rules of §4.4: `local_part` regex + consecutive dots + reserved names; `display_name` strip, 78 chars, no `@` or `://` | 3 |
| 16 | Shared constants and Zod schemas under the index's exact names | 3 |
| 17 | DTOs defined in full for W05's UI (domain row, identity, capability, list response, DNS record), including `SendingDomainDto.statusChangedAt` for the 72 h retry window and required `SenderIdentityDto.domain` / `.fromAddress`, pinned by a DTO-shape test | 3 |
| 18 | API-only rejections in `domainPolicy.ts`: hosted-only platform domains, consumer domains, public suffixes via `tldts`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST` | 4 |
| 19 | All ten `EMAIL_DOMAINS_*` vars of §11 declared and validated; `requireIf` keyed only on `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER`; `fake` refused in production; `static` refused when hosted; identical keys refused when hosted; one info line self-hosted | 5 |
| 20 | `services/emailDomains/config.ts`: `getEmailDomainsConfig`, `isPartnerLaneConfigured`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED` parsing (`domain` / `domain:partner-slug`), cap default 2000 hosted / unlimited self-hosted, `0` = unlimited | 5 |
| 21 | `.env.example`, `deploy/.env.example`, the `&api-env` anchor in `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` — **and** the root `docker-compose.yml`, which `envComposeParity.test.ts` also demands | 5 + amendment 2 |
| 22 | Deployment-mode matrix tests per §14, in the real `config/validate.test.ts` | 5 (Step 1) |
| 23 | `composeBindMounts.test.ts` checked (unaffected — it reads `volumes`, not `environment`) and an env-documentation contract test found (`envComposeParity.test.ts`) and satisfied | 5 (Steps 7, 8) |
| 24 | `provider.ts`: spec §5 types verbatim + `PartnerLaneMessage = RawEmailMessage` + `PartnerLaneSendFailure` | 6 |
| 25 | `providerRegistry.ts` with `getEmailDomainProvider` / `resetEmailDomainProviderForTests` | 6 |
| 26 | Find-then-create is W03 orchestration; W02 only guarantees the adapter inputs — stated explicitly and covered by tests | 6 (Interfaces), 9 |
| 27 | `resend` adapter written against the REAL installed signatures, version cited | 7 |
| 28 | Status mapping table §5.2 including unknown → `pending` + warning | 7 |
| 29 | Record normalisation to `ProviderDnsRecord` including the computed `fqdn` | 7 |
| 30 | Send-error classification into the four kinds over status code + error name, conservative `ambiguous` default, plus a recorded-fixture file W03's lab step refreshes | 7 |
| 31 | `static`: allow-list check with partner-slug binding, and how the slug reaches the adapter | 8 + amendment 4 |
| 32 | `static.send` via `getEmailService().deliverRaw`; SMTP/Mailgun/Resend sender refusal (550 5.7.60, 553, "domain not verified") → `domain_unusable`; everything else `ambiguous` / `message_rejected` | 8 |
| 33 | `fake`: deterministic `*.verify.test`, `*.fail.test`, `conflict.test`; `send` via `deliverRaw` | 8 |
| 34 | One adapter contract suite over `fake`, `static` and `resend` with a mocked SDK | 9 |
| 35 | `'custom_sending_domain'` added to `GatedCapability`, every enumerating site edited (API union, web union, web runtime `Set`, web label record), default-branch tests | 10 |
| 36 | `releaseSendingDomainsForPartner` in system context: outbox first for `provider_managed`, then null the handle, no provider calls | 11 |
| 37 | Called first in `cascadeDeletePartner` and in `finalizePartnerOffboarding`, with the exact insertion points and the DB-context reasoning | 11 |
| 38 | Integration suite in the correct directory covering all eight required cases plus constraint and idempotency cases | 12 |
| 39 | Verification: typecheck, listed unit files, `db:check-drift`, RLS + integration contract suites with the exact invocations, and the manual `breeze_app` forge | 13 |
