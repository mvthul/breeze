# Partner Sending Domains W05: Web UI and Docs — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

## Plan amendments

Deviations from the spec or from what the upstream plans left behind. Every one
was verified by reading the file cited. Items 1 and 2 were upstream gaps and are
now **RESOLVED** upstream — they are kept, struck through in substance, so the
contract they fixed is visible to the reviewer; the rest are UI decisions
recorded so nobody re-litigates them mid-task.

1. **RESOLVED upstream — `SenderIdentityDto.domain` and `.fromAddress` are now
   populated.** The gap was that W03's `toIdentityDto` mapped only
   `id, stream, sendingDomainId, localPart, displayName, replyTo, updatedAt` and
   cast with `as SenderIdentityDto`, over a query that never joined the domain,
   so neither declared field could be produced. W03 Task 6 now takes
   `toIdentityDto(row, domain)` against a joined `partner_sending_domains` and
   fills both. **What this wave still does, deliberately:** the rendered address
   comes from `fromAddressFor()` in `domainView.ts`, which composes
   `identity.localPart` with the domain row in the SAME response. That is not a
   workaround — the preview has to track the local part and domain the partner is
   editing right now, which no server field can know before the save. The wire
   value is the authority once saved; the form's preview is the authority while
   editing.
2. **RESOLVED upstream — `SendingDomainDto` now carries `statusChangedAt`.**
   The gap was that spec §10's `failed` row says "Retry (inside the window)"
   while the DTO exposed only `createdAt`, `verifiedAt` and `lastCheckedAt`, so
   the client had nothing to measure the 72 h against. W02 Task 3 now declares
   `statusChangedAt: string` (ISO, from a `NOT NULL` column) and W03 Task 6's
   `toDomainDto` fills it. **This wave therefore honours the window:**
   `isInsideRetryWindow(domain, nowMs)` in `domainView.ts` gates the "Try again"
   button, and an expired row shows the failure reason and Remove only. The
   server stays the authority — the 72 h is enforced in `requestDomainCheck`, so
   a click that races the boundary still surfaces the server's error through
   `runAction` like any other failure.
3. **Spec §10 "unsupported → tab hidden" and spec §5.1 "the settings tab
   explains `provider_key_send_only`" contradict each other**, because W03
   returns `supported: false` for both cases (plan lines 3078–3090). They are
   distinguishable by `capability.provider`: `null` for "no provider configured
   on this instance", the provider id for "configured but its key cannot manage
   domains". **Binding rule for this wave: the tab is hidden if and only if the
   `GET` 404s or `capability.provider === null`.** A non-null provider with
   `supported: false` renders the locked card with the
   `provider_key_send_only` explanation.
4. **Spec §10 restricts the DNS records table and "Check now" to `pending`.**
   This wave renders the records table whenever
   `capability.verifiesByDns && domain.dnsRecords.length > 0` (so a verified
   domain can still show what it published, all rows green) and renders
   "Check now" for `pending | verified | at_risk`. A re-check of a verified
   domain is what a partner reaches for after re-publishing a record, the route
   allows it, and it is rate-limited 1/min/domain server-side. This is a
   superset of §10, never a subtraction, and it is what makes the E2E
   deterministic (the button does not appear and disappear with poll timing).
5. **Spec §10 "not eligible → link to the trust page" has no target.** There is
   no partner-facing trust page in `apps/web/src/pages/**` (only
   `pages/admin/trust*`, which is platform-admin). The partner-facing trust
   surface is `TrustProbationBanner`, already mounted for this route at
   `apps/web/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.astro:58`. The locked card therefore
   renders a **"Show verification status"** button that calls
   `dispatchTrustDenied` (`apps/web/src/lib/trustProbation.ts:43`) — the same
   handoff `runAction` performs on a 403 — and falls back to an error toast
   when nothing handles it. No new page, no dead link.
6. **W03's "Assumed from W02" block is stale about
   `normalizeSendingDomain`.** It records
   `normalizeSendingDomain(input: string): string | null` (W03 plan line 97),
   but W02 Task 3 — the wave that defines it — ships
   `{ ok: true; domain: string } | { ok: false; reason: SendingDomainRejection }`
   (W02 plan lines 1003–1005, 1016–1055). **This wave consumes W02's shape**,
   which is the defining one.
7. **`fetchWithAuth` auto-injects `?orgId=`** (`apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:1335–1343`).
   `/partner/sending-domains` is partner-axis and ignores the parameter, so it
   is harmless — but every call in this wave passes `skipOrgIdInjection: true`
   anyway, so the request URL does not change when the user switches the org
   picker and the E2E `page.route` / `waitForResponse` matchers stay exact.
8. **`SettingsSectionNav` has no `data-testid` on its anchors**
   (`apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav.tsx:73-80`), and
   `e2e-tests/README.md:3` makes `data-testid` the only permitted selector. Task
   10 adds one derived id, `settings-nav-tab-<hash>`, which serves Partner
   Settings and Organization Settings alike.

---

**Goal:** Ship the partner-facing surface for custom sender addresses and the
operator-facing documentation. A trusted partner on an instance with
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` set can add a domain, copy its DNS records, watch it
verify, choose a sender address per mail stream, send a test message, and remove
the domain — every state of spec §10, in both the DNS (`resend`/`fake`) and the
operator-attested (`static`) variants. A self-hoster reading `apps/docs` can see
the three setups side by side and pick one. With `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` unset —
still the default everywhere — the tab does not appear and nothing changes.

**Architecture:** One typed client module (`lib/api/sendingDomains.ts`) owns
every call to the seven routes of spec §7; each mutation is lexically wrapped in
`runAction` there, so no caller can issue a silent mutation and the
`no-silent-mutations` AST guard is satisfied at the wrapper. One pure view-model
module (`components/settings/sendingDomains/domainView.ts`) turns a
`SendingDomainsListResponse` into the decisions the UI makes — which lock copy,
which failure copy, which record is missing, what the From address is, how fast
to poll — so those decisions are unit-tested without rendering. Five small
presentational components under `components/settings/sendingDomains/` render the
add form, the DNS table, the status banners, the identities form and the test
send. `PartnerSendingDomainTab.tsx` is the only stateful piece: it fetches,
polls, and hands data down. `PartnerSettingsPage.tsx` fetches the capability
best-effort and hides the tab when the instance has no provider.

**Tech Stack:** React 19 islands under Astro, `react-i18next` (namespace
`settings`, 8 shipped locales), Tailwind utility classes copied from the
neighbouring settings cards, Vitest + jsdom + `@testing-library/react`,
Playwright (`data-testid` only) against a `wt-stack` dev stack running the
`fake` provider, Astro Starlight for `apps/docs`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains-design.md`
— §4.2 (subdomain recommendation and its three reasons), §4.4 (identity rules
and the "where replies go" requirement), §8.3 (Reply-To precedence), §8.5
(no-inbound-configured warning), §10 (the state table this wave implements),
§11 (env var table for the docs page), §13 (the 2-minute provisioning delay
notice, the `static` relay-refusal text), §14 (the E2E bullet and the lab
check), §15 row W05, §16.1 (rollout steps), §16.2 (self-hosted docs bullets).
Plan index: `docs/superpowers/plans/integrations/2026-09-17-partner-sending-domains.md`.

## Global Constraints

Binding for every task. Do not relax one without changing the plan index in the
same PR.

- **UI state lives in `window.location.hash`, never a query parameter.** The new
  tab is reached at `/settings/partner#sending-domains` through the existing
  `HASH_TO_TAB` mechanism (`PartnerSettingsPage.tsx:135-139`). No `?tab=`.
- **Every POST / PUT / DELETE goes through `runAction`**
  (`apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`), wrapped lexically inside
  `lib/api/sendingDomains.ts`. Callers use the CLAUDE.md catch pattern:
  `if (err instanceof ActionError && err.status === 401) return;` then
  `if (!(err instanceof ActionError)) showToast({ type: 'error', … })`. The
  repo's `handleActionError(err, fallback)` helper implements exactly that and
  is what this wave calls. **Nothing is added to `runActionAllowlist.ts`.**
- **Every interactive element carries a `data-testid`**, and every E2E query is
  by `data-testid` — no text, role, label or CSS selectors
  (`e2e-tests/README.md:3`, "a hard rule, not a guideline"). Naming scheme:
  `sending-domains-<element>[-<modifier>]` for singletons,
  `sending-domain-row-<domainId>` and `sending-domain-record-<index>` for rows,
  `sending-identity-<stream>-<element>` for the per-stream identity controls.
- **Real translations in every shipped locale.** Eight locales:
  `en, pt-BR, es-419, fr-FR, fr-CA, de-DE, it-IT, tr-TR`. A key that exists in
  `en` and not in the other seven fails
  `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts:457`; a value byte-identical to
  English counts against `translationCoverage.test.ts:990`'s per-namespace
  baseline. Interpolation is `{{name}}` only — single braces are a protected
  literal, not interpolation. Technical literals (`DNS`, `SPF`, `DKIM`,
  `Breeze`, `Reply-To`, `mail.yourcompany.com`, `postmaster`, `abuse`,
  `mailer-daemon`) keep the same occurrence count in every locale.
- **The partner never types a full From address.** The identity form takes a
  local part and a domain chosen from the partner's verified domains; the
  address is composed for display only (spec §4.4).
- **The tab is hidden when the feature is unsupported** — and per plan amendment
  3 that means exactly: the `GET` 404s, or `capability.provider === null`.
- **Branch `feature/6180-partner-sending-domains/wave-6185`; the PR
  body contains `Closes #6185`.** `get_feature_status` before starting.
- **Web test command form:** `cd apps/web && npx vitest run <path>`. Never
  `pnpm --filter <pkg> test -- --run <path>` — pnpm forwards the literal `--`,
  vitest swallows `--run`, and the whole suite runs in watch mode. A trailing
  slash on a path filter silently skips sibling files, so list paths explicitly.
- **Commit after every task** with the trailer
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- **Rigor is low-ceremony but red-first** (index: "W01 and W05 are wide but
  low-risk: red first, typecheck, affected tests"). Write the failing assertion,
  run it, watch it fail, then implement. No plan/review/subagent ceremony.

## File Structure

| Path | Responsibility | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/locales/{en,pt-BR,es-419,fr-FR,fr-CA,de-DE,it-IT,tr-TR}/settings.json` | `partnerSendingDomains.*` + `partnerSettingsPage.tabs.sendingDomains.*` | 1 |
| `apps/web/src/lib/api/sendingDomains.ts` (+ `.test.ts`) | typed client for the seven routes; every mutation inside `runAction` | 2 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/domainView.ts` (+ `.test.ts`) | pure view-model: lock/failure copy keys, unhealthy record, From address, poll interval, error-code map | 3 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/AddDomainForm.tsx` (+ `.test.ts`) | add-domain form, shared-normaliser validation, subdomain recommendation | 4 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DnsRecordsTable.tsx` (+ `.test.ts`) | records table, per-record status, copy buttons, 72 h note | 5 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DomainStatusPanel.tsx` (+ `.test.ts`) | per-domain card: badge, banners, Check now, Retry, Remove, `lastSendError`, `static` note | 6 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/SenderIdentitiesForm.tsx` (+ `.test.ts`) | three streams, suggested local parts, where-replies-go text, save/clear | 7 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/TestSendControl.tsx` (+ `.test.ts`) | test send button + last result | 8 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSendingDomainTab.tsx` (+ `.test.tsx`) | fetch, poll, capability gating, composition | 9 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx` | tab registration in the communications group, capability fetch, render | 10 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav.tsx` | `data-testid="settings-nav-tab-<hash>"` on the rail anchors | 10 |
| `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx` | page-level mount test | 10 |
| `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts` | two `TARGET_GLOBS` entries + the count | 11 |
| `e2e-tests/pages/PartnerSendingDomainsPage.ts` | Playwright page object | 12 |
| `e2e-tests/tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts` | Playwright spec | 12 |
| `scripts/dev/wt-stack/env.ts` | `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER: 'fake'` for the dev/E2E stack | 12 |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake` in the `portal-dev-e2e` `.env`, spec added to the run list | 12 |
| `apps/docs/src/content/docs/deploy/custom-sender-addresses.mdx` | the operator + partner documentation page | 13 |
| `apps/docs/src/content/docs/deploy/environment.mdx` | cross-link at the end of `## Email` | 13 |

`apps/docs/astro.config.mjs` is **not** edited: the Deployment sidebar is
`autogenerate: { directory: 'deploy' }` (`astro.config.mjs:31-34`), so a new
`.mdx` in that directory is the entire sidebar change.

## Task 1: Translations for all eight locales

Everything the UI says, in one place, before any component exists. Doing i18n
first means each later component's test can assert real English copy.

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/en/settings.json` — add the `partnerSendingDomains` object, and `sendingDomains` inside `partnerSettingsPage.tabs`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/pt-BR/settings.json` — same keys, Brazilian Portuguese
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/es-419/settings.json` — same keys, Latin-American Spanish
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/fr-FR/settings.json` — same keys, French (France)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/fr-CA/settings.json` — same keys, French (Canada)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/de-DE/settings.json` — same keys, German
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/it-IT/settings.json` — same keys, Italian
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/tr-TR/settings.json` — same keys, Turkish

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the `settings:partnerSendingDomains.*` key group and
  `settings:partnerSettingsPage.tabs.sendingDomains.{label,description}`.
- Consumes: nothing. Components in Tasks 4–10 consume these keys.

- [ ] **Step 1: Watch parity fail**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts
```
Expected: PASS (nothing added yet). This is the baseline — note the run is
green so a failure after Step 2 is attributable.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the English keys only, and watch parity go red**

In `apps/web/src/locales/en/settings.json`, add `"sendingDomains"` to the
`partnerSettingsPage.tabs` object, immediately after the `"ticketing"` entry:

```json
      "sendingDomains": { "label": "Sender Addresses", "description": "Send email from your own domain" },
```

and add this new top-level section (alphabetical placement is not enforced;
put it immediately after the existing `"partnerSettingsPage"` object):

```json
  "partnerSendingDomains": {
    "title": "Custom sender addresses",
    "description": "Send customer-facing email from your own domain instead of the standard Breeze address.",

non-English locales, naming the `partnerSendingDomains.*` keys and
`partnerSettingsPage.tabs.sendingDomains.*`.

- [ ] **Step 3: pt-BR**

Add to `apps/web/src/locales/pt-BR/settings.json`, in the same two places:

```json

- [ ] **Step 10: Run the whole i18n suite green**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib/i18n
```
Expected: all PASS.

If `translationCoverage.test.ts` fails on
`does not exceed reviewed namespace duplicate baselines`, the cause is one of
the two values that are deliberately identical in every locale:
`addPlaceholder` (`mail.yourcompany.com`) and `identityDisplayNamePlaceholder`
(`Acme Support`) — both are sample values, and localising them would break
`localeParity.test.ts:513`'s protected-literal occurrence count. Raise the
`settings` baseline for the affected locale by the exact number reported, with
this comment above the number, matching the file's existing style:

```ts
    // +2 (partner sending domains W05): `addPlaceholder` and
    // `identityDisplayNamePlaceholder` are sample values — a domain example and
    // a sample display name. Localising them would change the protected-literal
    // occurrence count that localeParity.test.ts:513 pins against English.
```

Every decision the tab makes — tab visibility, locked copy, failure copy, the
missing record, sendable domains, the From address, the poll interval, the
two-minute provisioning notice, the 72-hour retry window — as pure functions, so
spec §10's state table is tested without rendering. The From address is composed
from the domain row in the same response because the form has to preview the
values being edited, which the saved identity's own fromAddress cannot know.

## Task 4: `AddDomainForm`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/AddDomainForm.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/AddDomainForm.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeSendingDomain` from `@breeze/shared` (W02 Task 3 — returns
  `{ ok: true; domain } | { ok: false; reason }`), `useTranslation('settings')`.

## Task 5: `DnsRecordsTable`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DnsRecordsTable.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DnsRecordsTable.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SendingDomainDnsRecordDto` from `@breeze/shared`, `showToast`
  (`apps/web/src/components/shared/Toast`), `useTranslation('settings')`.
- Produces:
  ```tsx
  export interface DnsRecordsTableProps {
    records: SendingDomainDnsRecordDto[];
    /** Suppresses the 72-hour note once the domain is verified. */
    showPendingNote: boolean;
  }
  export default function DnsRecordsTable(props: DnsRecordsTableProps): JSX.Element | null;

## Task 7: `SenderIdentitiesForm`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/SenderIdentitiesForm.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/sendingDomains/SenderIdentitiesForm.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `senderLocalPartSchema`, `senderDisplayNameSchema`,
  `SendingDomainDto`, `SenderIdentityDto`, `PartnerMailStreamValue` from
  `@breeze/shared` (W02 Task 3); `SENDING_DOMAIN_STREAMS`,
  `SUGGESTED_LOCAL_PARTS`, `sendableDomains`, `fromAddressFor` (Task 3).
- Produces:
  ```tsx
  export interface SenderIdentitiesFormProps {
    domains: SendingDomainDto[];
    identities: SenderIdentityDto[];
    /** From GET /ticket-config: whether this instance has an inbound address, and which. */
    inbound: { configured: boolean; address: string | null };
    busy: boolean;
    onSave: (input: {
      stream: PartnerMailStreamValue; sendingDomainId: string;
      localPart: string; displayName: string | null; replyTo: string | null;
    }) => void | Promise<void>;
    onClear: (stream: PartnerMailStreamValue) => void | Promise<void>;
  }
  export default function SenderIdentitiesForm(props: SenderIdentitiesFormProps): JSX.Element;
  ```
- testids: `sending-domains-identities`, `sending-domains-identities-empty`,
  and per stream `sending-identity-<stream>`, `-domain`, `-localpart`,
  `-displayname`, `-replyto`, `-save`, `-clear`, `-from`, `-replies`, `-error`.

Support, billing and general, each seeded with the spec §3.2 suggested local
part, validated with the shared identity schemas, and each stating where replies
land under the §8.3 precedence — including the §8.5 warning when this instance
has no inbound address at all. The partner picks a local part and a verified
domain; the From address is composed for display only.

 * Polling follows spec §10: 2 s while provisioning, 15 s while waiting for DNS
 * (or while a removal or test send is in flight), nothing once everything has
 * settled. It stops on unmount and while the browser tab is hidden, so a
 * forgotten tab never holds a 2-second loop open.

The one stateful piece: it reads the list, polls at 2 s while provisioning and
15 s while waiting for DNS, stops on unmount and while the browser tab is hidden,
and routes every mutation through the typed client. A locked card explains an
ineligible partner and hands trust denials to the banner that already knows how
to explain them.

## Task 10: MOUNT — register the tab in Partner Settings

**This is the last task that builds UI.** Without it every component of Tasks
4–9 exists, compiles, and is unreachable: nothing renders
`PartnerSendingDomainTab`, and `/settings/partner#sending-domains` falls back to
the Company tab.

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx`
  - the `lucide-react` import list (`:2-18`) gains `AtSign`
  - a new import of `PartnerSendingDomainTab` beside the other tab imports (`:32`)
  - the `@breeze/shared` type import block (`:38-53`) gains `SendingDomainsCapabilityDto`
  - new imports of `fetchSendingDomains` and `isTabVisible`
  - `TabKey` (`:61`) gains `'sendingDomains'`
  - the **communications** group of `TAB_GROUPS` (`:112-120`) gains the tab, after `ticketing`
  - `SnapshotKey` (`:158`) excludes `'sendingDomains'` — it is self-saving
  - new `sendingDomainsCapability` / `sendingDomainsChecked` state beside `pinnableVersions` (`:224`)
  - a best-effort capability read in `fetchPartner`, after the `/agent-versions/pinnable` block (`:329-332`)
  - a `visibleGroups` memo and a bounce effect
  - the nav render (`:574-582`) uses `visibleGroups`
  - a render branch after the ticketing branch (`:694-701`)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav.tsx` — a
  `data-testid` on the rail anchor (`:73-80`)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PartnerSendingDomainTab` (Task 9), `fetchSendingDomains` (Task 2),
  `isTabVisible` (Task 3), `SendingDomainsCapabilityDto` (`@breeze/shared`).
- Produces: the tab at `/settings/partner#sending-domains`, hidden when the
  instance has no provider; `data-testid="settings-nav-tab-<hash>"` on every
  Partner-Settings and Organization-Settings rail anchor.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing page test**

Create `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx`:

```tsx

});
```

Run: `cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL — no `settings-nav-tab-company` testid exists yet.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the nav testid**

In `apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav.tsx`, on the rail anchor
(`:73`), add one attribute after `aria-label`:

```tsx
                      data-testid={`settings-nav-tab-${item.hash}`}
```

so the element reads:

```tsx
                    <a
                      href={`#${item.hash}`}
                      aria-current={isActive ? 'page' : undefined}
                      aria-label={item.dirty ? t('settingsSectionNav.unsavedChanges', { label: item.label }) : item.label}
                      data-testid={`settings-nav-tab-${item.hash}`}
                      onClick={e => {
```

It is derived from `item.hash`, so Partner Settings and Organization Settings
both get one and neither needs a hard-coded list. `e2e-tests/README.md` permits
no other selector, so this is what makes the nav reachable at all.

- [ ] **Step 3: Register the tab**

In `apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx`:

Add `AtSign,` as the first entry of the `lucide-react` import list (`:2-18`,
alphabetical — before `Bell`):

```tsx
import {
  AtSign,
  Bell,
```

Add the tab import after the `PartnerRemoteAccessTab` import (`:32`):

```tsx
import PartnerSendingDomainTab from './PartnerSendingDomainTab';
```

Add `SendingDomainsCapabilityDto` to the existing `@breeze/shared` type import
block (`:38-53`), after `IpAllowlistStatus`:

```tsx
  IpAllowlistStatus,
  SendingDomainsCapabilityDto
} from '@breeze/shared';
```

Add two value imports after the `runAction` import (`:56`):

```tsx
import { fetchSendingDomains } from '@/lib/api/sendingDomains';
import { isTabVisible } from './sendingDomains/domainView';
```

Widen `TabKey` (`:61`):

```tsx
type TabKey = 'company' | 'regional' | 'security' | 'notifications' | 'eventLogs' | 'defaults' | 'branding' | 'loginBranding' | 'aiBudgets' | 'aiProvider' | 'remoteAccess' | 'ticketing' | 'sendingDomains';
```

Add the tab to the **communications** group (`:112-120`), immediately after the
`ticketing` entry — it belongs beside the ticketing tab that holds
`InboundEmailCard`, which is the inbound half of the same subject:

```tsx
      { key: 'sendingDomains', hash: 'sending-domains', label: 'partnerSettingsPage.tabs.sendingDomains.label', description: 'partnerSettingsPage.tabs.sendingDomains.description', icon: AtSign, selfSaving: true },
```

Exclude it from dirty tracking (`:158`) — it persists its own changes, exactly
like Ticketing and the AI provider tab:

```tsx
type SnapshotKey = Exclude<TabKey, 'ticketing' | 'loginBranding' | 'aiProvider' | 'sendingDomains'>;
```

Add state beside `pinnableVersions` (`:224`):

```tsx
  // Capability only: the tab does its own full read. `checked` distinguishes
  // "not fetched yet" from "fetched and this instance has no provider", so a
  // deep link to #sending-domains does not bounce to Company mid-flight.
  const [sendingDomainsCapability, setSendingDomainsCapability] = useState<SendingDomainsCapabilityDto | null>(null);
  const [sendingDomainsChecked, setSendingDomainsChecked] = useState(false);
```

Add the best-effort read in `fetchPartner`, immediately after the
`/agent-versions/pinnable` block (`:329-332`):

```tsx
      // Best-effort: decides whether the Sender Addresses tab appears at all.
      // A 404 means EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER is unset on this instance — the
      // default everywhere — and the tab stays hidden.
      fetchSendingDomains()
        .then((result) => setSendingDomainsCapability(result.supported ? result.data.capability : null))
        .catch(() => setSendingDomainsCapability(null))
        .finally(() => setSendingDomainsChecked(true));
```

Add the visibility memo and the bounce effect immediately after the
`navigateToTab` definition (`:378-382`):

```tsx
  const sendingDomainsVisible = isTabVisible(sendingDomainsCapability);

  // TAB_GROUPS stays a module constant so HASH_TO_TAB keeps resolving
  // `#sending-domains`; visibility is applied to the rendered nav only.
  const visibleGroups = useMemo(
    () => TAB_GROUPS.map(group => ({
      ...group,
      tabs: group.tabs.filter(tab => tab.key !== 'sendingDomains' || sendingDomainsVisible),
    })),
    [sendingDomainsVisible]
  );

  // A bookmark to a tab this instance hides falls back to Company — but only
  // once the capability read has actually settled.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (sendingDomainsChecked && !sendingDomainsVisible && activeTab === 'sendingDomains') {
      setActiveTab('company');
    }
  }, [sendingDomainsChecked, sendingDomainsVisible, activeTab]);
```

Point the nav at the filtered groups (`:575`):

```tsx
          groups={visibleGroups.map(group => ({
```

And render the tab, after the ticketing branch (`:694-701`) and before the
closing `</div>`:

```tsx
          {/* Custom sender addresses: partner sending domains, DNS records,
              per-stream sender identities and the test send. Self-contained
              with its own load/save, so the top-level "Save Settings" button
              does not apply here. */}
          {activeTab === 'sendingDomains' && sendingDomainsVisible && <PartnerSendingDomainTab />}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the page tests green**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav
pnpm exec astro check
```
Expected: both suites PASS and `astro check` reports no errors. If the existing
`PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx` fails on an unrouted `/partner/sending-domains`
call, its `fetchWithAuthMock.mockResolvedValue(makeJsonResponse({ data: [] }))`
default already answers it — the capability read is `.catch`-guarded, so a
malformed body only leaves the tab hidden.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsSectionNav.tsx apps/web/src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): mount the Sender Addresses tab in Partner Settings

Registered in the communications group beside Ticketing, deep-linked through the
existing window.location.hash mechanism, and hidden whenever the capability read
404s or reports no provider — the default on every instance that has not set
EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER. The settings rail anchors gain a derived data-testid so
E2E can reach them at all.

## Task 11: Register the new files with the silent-mutation guard

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts`
  - two entries appended to `TARGET_GLOBS`, immediately before the closing `];`
    that follows `'src/components/settings/ProfilePage.tsx'` (`:334-335`)
  - the count assertion (`:675`) 143 → 145, with a comment in the existing style
- **Not** modified: `apps/web/src/lib/runActionAllowlist.ts`. Nothing here needs
  an allowlist entry: every mutation is lexically inside `runAction` in the
  client module, which is what `isMutatingApiWrapper`
  (`no-silent-mutations.test.ts:424-449`) checks before it flags a caller.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the files created in Tasks 2 and 9.
- Produces: nothing importable.

- [ ] **Step 1: Watch the count assertion fail**

Append to `TARGET_GLOBS`:

```ts
  // Partner sending domains W05: the client module holds every mutation for the
  // custom-sender-address surface (add / check / remove / identity upsert and
  // clear / test send), each already wrapped in runAction. Guarding the file is
  // about the NEXT mutation — a bare fetchWithAuth added beside them would
  // silently fail on the surface that decides what address a partner's
  // customers see mail from, and would also un-guard every caller, because
  // isMutatingApiWrapper only clears a caller while the wrapper stays wrapped.
  'src/lib/api/sendingDomains.ts',
  // The tab itself has no fetchWithAuth today — it goes through the client
  // above — and is listed so a future direct mutation cannot be added here
  // without CI noticing. TARGET_GLOBS is a literal file list, not directory-wide.
  'src/components/settings/PartnerSendingDomainTab.tsx',
```

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
```
Expected: FAIL on `expected 145 to be 143` in the guarded-file-count test.

- [ ] **Step 2: Bump the count**

At `:675`, append to the running comment and change the number:

```ts
    // #4050 adds settings/ProfilePage.tsx (account security): 142 → 143.
    // Partner sending domains W05 adds lib/api/sendingDomains.ts and
    // settings/PartnerSendingDomainTab.tsx: 143 → 145.
    expect(absoluteFiles.length).toBe(145);
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run green and commit**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
```
Expected: all PASS, including the per-file
`src/lib/api/sendingDomains.ts: every mutating fetchWithAuth is wrapped by
runAction or explicitly exempt`.

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
git commit -m "test(web): guard the sending-domain client against silent mutations

Both new files join TARGET_GLOBS. No runActionAllowlist entry is needed — every
mutation is lexically inside runAction in the client module, which is also what
keeps its callers clear of the guard.

## Task 12: E2E — page object, spec, and the `fake` provider in the stack

**How `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake` reaches the API and the worker.** W02 Task 5
already did the plumbing that makes the variable *possible*: it declared the key
in `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts`, documented it in `.env.example` and
`deploy/.env.example`, and mapped it in the `x-api-env: &api-env` anchor of both
`docker-compose.yml` and `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`. That anchor is merged
by the `api` service **and** the `worker` service, which is the only mechanism
that reaches both containers — Compose interpolates only what the anchor names,
so a value in `.env` alone is inert. **W05 adds nothing to those four files.**
What is left is choosing the value in the two places that start an E2E stack:
`scripts/dev/wt-stack/env.ts` for a local run, and the `portal-dev-e2e` job's
`.env` heredoc for CI. The dev stack runs one `api` container with
`BREEZE_ROLE=all` (there is no separate `worker` container locally or in CI), so
the same process serves the routes and runs the `sending-domains` worker.

**Files:**
- Create: `e2e-tests/pages/PartnerSendingDomainsPage.ts`
- Create: `e2e-tests/tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts`
- Modify: `scripts/dev/wt-stack/env.ts` — one entry in `DEV_ENV`, after
  `MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN: 'false',` (`:40`)
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — one line in the `portal-dev-e2e` job's
  "Create .env for the dev stack" heredoc, after `MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN=false`
  (`~:3427`); and the spec appended to the "Run the portal hydration specs"
  command (`:3511`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `BasePage` (`e2e-tests/pages/BasePage.ts`), `waitForAppReady`
  (`e2e-tests/pages/hydration.ts`), the `authedPage` fixture
  (`e2e-tests/fixtures.ts:12`), `clearRefreshState`
  (`e2e-tests/test-helpers.ts:29`), and the `fake` adapter's deterministic
  domain names (W02 Task 8): `*.verify.test` verifies, `*.fail.test` fails,
  `conflict.test` conflicts, `preexisting.*` is adopted already verified.
- Produces: `export class PartnerSendingDomainsPage extends BasePage`.

Two facts the executor should not re-derive:
- `authedPage` **is** the partner-scoped session (`admin@breeze.local`, the
  seeded `Partner Admin`). There is no second partner fixture.
- The write routes carry `requireMfa()`. That passes here because
  `MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN=false` makes the effective MFA policy
  non-required for that admin, so login mints `mfa: true`
  (`routes/auth/login.ts:632`). Both stacks already pin that variable; do not
  remove it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Set the provider for the local dev stack**

In `scripts/dev/wt-stack/env.ts`, add to `DEV_ENV` immediately after
`MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN: 'false',`:

```ts
  // Partner sending domains W05. `fake` is the deterministic adapter: it makes
  // no external calls, verifies `*.verify.test` on the first check, fails
  // `*.fail.test`, and hands a send to the platform transport so Mailpit shows
  // the custom From. config/validate.ts refuses it in production, and the
  // settings tab is hidden whenever this is unset — which is why the E2E spec
  // needs it. .env.stack is passed LAST to compose, so this wins over a stale
  // root .env, and docker-compose.yml's x-api-env anchor (added in W02) is what
  // carries it into the api and worker containers.
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER: 'fake',
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the page object**

Create `e2e-tests/pages/PartnerSendingDomainsPage.ts`:

```ts
import { BasePage } from './BasePage';
import { waitForAppReady } from './hydration';

/**
 * `/settings/partner#sending-domains` — custom sender addresses.
 *
 * Navigation is by URL fragment rather than by clicking the rail, because the
 * tab state of this page lives in `window.location.hash`; `navTab()` is here so
 * a test can still assert the tab is (or is not) offered in the nav.
 *
 * Every locator is a `data-testid` — e2e-tests/README.md makes that the only
 * permitted selector.
 */
export class PartnerSendingDomainsPage extends BasePage {
  url = '/settings/partner#sending-domains';

  root = () => this.page.getByTestId('partner-sending-domains-tab');

  testSubmit = (id: string) => this.page.getByTestId(`sending-domain-${id}-test-submit`);

  identityFrom = (stream: string) => this.page.getByTestId(`sending-identity-${stream}-from`);
  identityClear = (stream: string) => this.page.getByTestId(`sending-identity-${stream}-clear`);

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto(this.url);
    await this.waitUntilReady();
  }

   * silently swallowed. Wait for a hydrated root every time.
   */
  async waitUntilReady() {
    await waitForAppReady(this.page, 'partner-sending-domains-tab');
  }

  /** Add a domain and return the created row's id, read from the POST response. */
  async addDomain(domain: string): Promise<string> {
    await this.addInput().fill(domain);
    const [response] = await Promise.all([
      this.page.waitForResponse(
        (r) => r.request().method() === 'POST'
          && new URL(r.url()).pathname.endsWith('/partner/sending-domains'),
      ),
      this.addSubmit().click(),
    ]);
    const body = (await response.json()) as { id: string };
    return body.id;
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the spec**

Create `e2e-tests/tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures';
import { clearRefreshState } from '../test-helpers';
import { PartnerSendingDomainsPage } from '../pages/PartnerSendingDomainsPage';

/**
 * Partner sending domains W05 — the browser slice of spec §14's E2E bullet.
 *
 * Runs against the `fake` email-domain provider (EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake in
 * the dev stack), whose behaviour is keyed on the DOMAIN NAME, so no seeding is
 * needed: `*.verify.test` verifies on the first check and `*.fail.test` fails.
 * Each test mints a unique label so re-running against a live stack cannot trip
 * the `UNIQUE (domain)` constraint.
 *
 * What only a browser proves here: that the tab is reachable from the URL hash
 * at all, that the DNS records the API returns actually render, and that the
 * add → verify → configure → test → remove loop survives the polling that
 * refreshes the page underneath each step.
 */
test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });
test.beforeEach(clearRefreshState);

function uniqueDomain(suffix: string): string {
  return `w04-${Date.now().toString(36)}-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1e6).toString(36)}.${suffix}`;
}

test.describe('Partner sending domains', () => {

});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Wire CI**

In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, in the `portal-dev-e2e` job's
"Create .env for the dev stack" heredoc, after
`MFA_FORCE_FOR_PARTNER_ADMIN=false`:

```
          # tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts needs a sending-domain
          # provider; `fake` is deterministic and makes no external calls.
          # Redundant with wt-stack's .env.stack, which is passed last, but this
          # job spells such keys out by convention.
          EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake
```

and append the spec to the run command (`:3511`):

```
        run: ./e2e-tests/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/dev/wt-stack/cli.ts test -- tests/multi-currency.spec.ts tests/portal-visibility.spec.ts tests/ai-agents.spec.ts tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts
```

Note for the reviewer, to be repeated in the PR body: `portal-dev-e2e` carries
`continue-on-error: true` (ci.yml:3358) and is not in `ci-success`'s `needs`, so
this spec cannot fail the build. It is signal, not a gate.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run it against a real stack**

`e2e-tests/README.md:117` — "Don't merge a spec that hasn't been verified
against a running stack."

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm wt-stack up
pnpm wt-stack test -- tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts
pnpm wt-stack down
```
Expected: three tests PASS. Tear the stack down — nothing reaps it for you.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
git add e2e-tests/pages/PartnerSendingDomainsPage.ts e2e-tests/tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts scripts/dev/wt-stack/env.ts .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "test(e2e): partner sending domains against the fake provider

Add, verify, configure the support stream, test send and remove, plus the
provider-rejection path and the not-eligible locked card. The dev stack and the
portal-dev-e2e job set EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=fake; the compose mapping that
carries it into the api and worker containers already shipped in W02.

## Task 13: Documentation — `apps/docs` page and the cross-link

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/deploy/custom-sender-addresses.mdx`
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/deploy/environment.mdx` — one cross-link
  line at the end of the `## Email` table (`:152`, immediately before
  `## SMS (Twilio)` at `:153`)
- **Not** modified: `apps/docs/astro.config.mjs`. The Deployment sidebar is
  `autogenerate: { directory: 'deploy' }` (`:31-34`), so dropping the file into
  that directory *is* the sidebar change. Ordering comes from `sidebar.order` in
  the frontmatter.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Aside`, `Steps`, `Tabs`, `TabItem` from
  `@astrojs/starlight/components` — the four components every deploy page uses,
  imported on line 9 exactly as `production.mdx:9` does.
- Produces: the page at `/deploy/custom-sender-addresses/`.

Nothing in CI validates internal links or sidebar coverage — `astro check` only
type-checks frontmatter against `docsSchema()` and the component imports. Read
the cross-link back once by eye.

  label: Custom Sender Addresses
---

import { Aside, Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Out of the box, every email Breeze sends leaves from one address: whatever you
set as `EMAIL_FROM`. That is fine for a single-tenant install, but it means a
ticket update, an invoice and a password reset all arrive from the same mailbox,
and on a multi-partner server they all arrive from yours.

Custom sender addresses let a partner send customer-facing mail from a domain
they control, with a different address per kind of mail — `support@` for ticket
updates, `billing@` for quotes and invoices. This page is about the mail Breeze
**sends**. It has nothing to do with `TICKETS_INBOUND_DOMAIN`, which is the
address Breeze **receives** on, or with `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`.

<Aside>
  This is entirely opt-in. Upgrading changes nothing: the release adds three
  empty tables, no new environment variable is required, the background worker
  is not registered, the settings tab is hidden, and every email is byte for byte
  what it was before. Nothing below happens until you set
  `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER`.
</Aside>

## Which setup you want

| | One address | Per-stream addresses | DNS wizard |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` | unset | `static` | `resend` |
| Works on | any transport | any transport — SMTP relay, Mailgun, Resend | Resend only |
| Who proves the domain | you, by setting `EMAIL_FROM` | you, by listing it and sending a test | the partner, by publishing DNS records |
| Addresses you get | one, for everything | one per mail stream | one per mail stream |
| Extra setup | none | your relay must already be allowed to send as those addresses | a Resend key that can manage domains |
| Suits | a single-tenant install | most self-hosters | a server with several partners, or one that wants Breeze to check DNS |

## One address for everything

This is what you already have. `EMAIL_FROM` is the sender for every message, and
you can give it a display name:

```bash
EMAIL_FROM="Acme IT <support@acme.com>"
```

Nothing else on this page applies. Skip to [Environment
Variables](/deploy/environment/) if that is all you wanted.

## Per-stream addresses on any relay

Set `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=static` when you relay through SMTP, Microsoft 365,
Postfix, Amazon SES SMTP or Mailgun — anywhere Breeze has no domain API to ask.
You tell Breeze which domains this server's mail relay is allowed to send as,
and Breeze takes you at your word.

<Aside type="caution" title="The precondition, in one sentence">
  Your relay must already be allowed to send as those addresses — Microsoft 365
  SendAs rights, a Postfix sender map, the relay's own verified domains — with
  SPF and DKIM for the domain already in place.
</Aside>

**Listing a domain does not authorise it.** `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED` is
your statement that the relay will accept those senders; Breeze cannot check it,
and it does not publish, sign or verify anything on your behalf. SPF and DKIM for
those domains are part of your mail setup, not part of Breeze.

<Steps>

1. **List the domains, then restart.**

   ```bash
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=static
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED=acme.com
   ```

   On a server with more than one partner, bind each entry to the partner that
   may claim it, by slug:

   ```bash
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED=acme.com:acme,northwind.example:northwind
   ```

   An unbound entry can be claimed by any partner on the server, which is the
   right behaviour for a single-partner install and the wrong one for a shared
   server. A partner who tries to add a domain you have not listed is told to ask
   their Breeze administrator.

2. **Add the domain in the interface.**

   Partner Settings, under Communications, now has a **Sender Addresses** tab.
   Add the domain there. It sits in "Waiting for DNS" until the next step —
   there are no DNS records to publish in this mode.

3. **Send the test email, which is what verifies it.**

   The test sends one real message from the domain to your own sign-in address.
   If your relay accepts it, the domain becomes verified and usable. If the relay
   refuses the sender, the domain stays unverified and the relay's refusal is
   shown verbatim, which is almost always a missing SendAs right or a sender map
   that does not cover the address.

4. **Choose the addresses.**

   Set the local part for each stream you care about. A stream you leave alone
   keeps sending from `EMAIL_FROM`; there is no implicit fallback between
   streams, so what you configure is exactly what changes.

</Steps>

If your relay later stops accepting the sender — a SendAs right is revoked, say —
the message is not lost: it goes out from `EMAIL_FROM` instead, and the refusal
appears on the domain so you can fix it.

## The DNS wizard

Set `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=resend` when your Breeze server sends through Resend
and you want Breeze to create the domain, show the records to publish, and check
them for you. This is what hosted Breeze runs.

<Steps>

1. **Use a key that can manage domains.**

   ```bash
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=resend
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
   EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

   It must be a `full_access` key. A sending-only key can send mail but cannot
   create or check a domain, and Breeze will say so in the settings tab rather
   than failing every attempt. One account for both the platform sender and
   partner domains is fine on a self-hosted server — see the trade-off below.

2. **Add the domain in Partner Settings.**

   Breeze creates it at the provider and shows the DKIM, SPF and return-path
   records to publish, each with the exact name that has to resolve.

3. **Publish the records and wait.**

   Breeze re-checks on its own — every two minutes at first, then less often —
   and you can force a check from the tab. DNS changes can take up to 72 hours to
   become visible.

</Steps>

**A domain that is already verified in your Resend account is adopted, not
recreated.** It shows as verified immediately, and Breeze will never delete it —
removing it from Breeze drops the local record and leaves your provider account
untouched. That matters because the domain you are most likely to add is the one
your `EMAIL_FROM` already uses.

## Environment variables

Every one of these is optional, and none is ever required by an upgrade.
Validation only ever complains about a contradiction you introduced — `resend`
with no key, or `fake` in production.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` | unset | `resend`, `static` or `fake`. Unset means the feature is off: the settings tab is hidden and the routes answer 404. `fake` is a deterministic test double, refused in production |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED` | empty | `static` only. Comma-separated `domain` or `domain:partner-slug`. Your statement that this server's relay may send as these domains |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY` | — | `resend` only, required. A `full_access` key; a sending-only key cannot manage domains |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY` | falls back to the key above | Optional sending-only key of the same account, so the send path never holds the management key |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Region for newly created domains: `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, `sa-east-1`, `ap-northeast-1` |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER` | `3` | How many sending domains one partner may hold |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP` | unlimited when self-hosted | Messages per partner per UTC day on the custom-domain lane. `0` is unlimited. Over the cap, mail goes out from `EMAIL_FROM` as it would today |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST` | empty | Comma-separated partner ids. Empty means every eligible partner |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST` | empty | Extra domains nobody on this server may add |
| `EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Delivery-webhook signing secret. Unset leaves the endpoint inert, which is the right setting behind NAT or a VPN |

## Mapping the variables into your containers

If you run the compose file that ships with Breeze, the upgrade brings the
mapping with it and there is nothing to do. If you maintain your own compose
file, a value in `.env` alone is inert — Compose only interpolates what the
service block names. Add these to the environment of both your `api` service and,
if you run one, your `worker` service:

```yaml
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST:-}
  EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET: ${EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET:-}
```

The domain worker runs wherever your background jobs run, so if you have split
the worker into its own container the same block has to reach it too.

## What sharing one Resend account trades away

Hosted Breeze keeps partner-domain mail in a **separate** Resend account from the
mail that carries password resets and security notices, and refuses to start if
the two keys match. Self-hosted, you may point
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY` at the same account as `RESEND_API_KEY`, and
Breeze logs one informational line when you do.

What you give up is isolation of reputation. Resend enforces its bounce and spam
limits **account-wide**: if mail from a partner's domain draws enough complaints
to pause the account, it pauses password resets and account-recovery mail with
it. On a single-partner server that is usually an acceptable trade, since it is
all your own mail either way. On a server with several partners it is not — one
partner's list hygiene can lock everyone else out of their own account. Use a
second Resend account there.

## What your technicians will see

The **Sender Addresses** tab lives in Partner Settings, under Communications,
next to Ticketing. Three things on it are worth explaining once.

**A dedicated subdomain is better than the root domain.** Both work, and the tab
says so, but `mail.acme.com` keeps the sending reputation of Breeze mail separate
from the rest of the company's mail; a root domain already verified with the
email provider somewhere else cannot be added at all, because Breeze never takes
a domain away from another account; and some mail filters flag an outside sender
that uses the recipient's own domain even when DKIM passes, which matters most
for internal teams whose customers are colleagues.

**The DNS records are shown with the exact name that has to resolve.** DKIM lives
under `resend._domainkey`, and SPF and the return path under `send`, so none of
them collide with the mail the domain already handles. The most common reason a
domain never verifies is pasting the short label where the provider wanted the
full name, which is why both are on screen.

**Replies do not always go where the From address does.** Ticket email sets
Reply-To to the Breeze inbound address, so a customer's reply lands back on the
ticket. Quotes and invoices set Reply-To to the partner's billing email. Portal
invitations, password resets and scheduled reports set no Reply-To at all, so a
reply goes to the address chosen in the tab. Make each address a real mailbox or
an alias: people and auto-responders answer the From address regardless of what
Reply-To says. On a server with no inbound address configured at all, that is
true of ticket email too, and the tab warns about it.

In `apps/docs/src/content/docs/deploy/environment.mdx`, after the last row of
the `## Email` table (`:152`) and before `## SMS (Twilio)` (`:153`), insert a

Run:

git commit -m "docs(deploy): custom sender addresses

The three setups side by side — one address via EMAIL_FROM, per-stream addresses
on any relay via static, and the DNS wizard via resend — with the precondition
for static stated plainly, the full EMAIL_DOMAINS_* table, the compose mapping
for operators on their own compose file, the multi-partner slug binding, and what
sharing one Resend account between the two lanes trades away.

## Task 14: Release-notes callout (ready to paste at cut time)

Release notes are written when the release is cut, not here, so this task
**adds no file**. It records the text so the person cutting the release does not
have to reconstruct it, and so the reviewer can check it against §16.2.

**Files:**
- None. This block is copied into the GitHub Release body's self-hoster section
  by the `release` skill when the release that contains W05 is cut.

- [ ] **Step 1: Record the block in the PR body**

Paste this into the PR description under a `## Release notes` heading, so it
travels with the change and the release author finds it by searching the merged
PRs in the range:

```markdown
### Custom sender addresses (optional, off by default)

**Upgrading is a no-op.** This release adds three empty tables. No new
environment variable is required, no existing one changes meaning, the domain
worker is not registered, the new settings tab is hidden, and every email is
byte for byte what it was before. Nothing changes until you opt in.

If you want per-stream sender addresses — `support@` for ticket updates,
`billing@` for quotes and invoices — instead of one `EMAIL_FROM` for everything,
there are two ways in:

- **On SMTP, Microsoft 365, Postfix or Mailgun:** set
  `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=static` and `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED=yourdomain.com`,
  restart, add the domain in Partner Settings → Sender Addresses, and send the
  test email that verifies it. Your relay must already be allowed to send as
  those addresses, with SPF and DKIM for the domain already in place — listing a
  domain here does not authorise it.
- **On Resend:** set `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=resend` and
  `EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY` to a `full_access` key (a sending-only key
  cannot manage domains). A domain already verified in your account is adopted,
  shows as verified at once, and is never deleted by Breeze.

New optional variables, all unset by default: `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER`,
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY`,
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_SENDING_KEY`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION`,
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_MAX_PER_PARTNER`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_DAILY_SEND_CAP`,
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_DENYLIST`,
`EMAIL_DOMAINS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

If you maintain your own compose file rather than the one that ships with
Breeze, the variables need mapping into the `api` (and `worker`) service
environment — a value in `.env` alone is inert. The lines to add are in
[Custom sender addresses](https://docs.breezermm.com/deploy/custom-sender-addresses/).
```

## Task 15: Verification

The last task. Nothing new is written here; everything is run.

**Files:**
- None.

- [ ] **Step 1: Type-check the web app**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
pnpm exec astro check
```
Expected: 0 errors, 0 warnings from the new files. This is the exact command
CI's `typecheck` job runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:305-307`); there is no
`typecheck` script in `apps/web/package.json`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run every test file this wave created or touched**

Run, as one command so the file count is visible:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run \
  src/lib/api/sendingDomains.test.ts \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/domainView.test.ts \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/AddDomainForm.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DnsRecordsTable.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/SenderIdentitiesForm.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/sendingDomains/TestSendControl.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/PartnerSendingDomainTab.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx \
  src/components/settings/PartnerSettingsPage.test.tsx
```
Expected: **10 test files**, all PASS. Check the reported file count — vitest's
path filter is a plain substring match, so a typo silently runs fewer files than
you listed rather than erroring.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the two contract suites this wave has to satisfy, by path**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain/apps/web
npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts
npx vitest run src/lib/i18n
```
Expected: both PASS. The second covers `localeParity`, `translationCoverage`,
`keyUsage`, `extractionQuality` and `terminologyQuality` — the suite that fails
on a missing locale key, an English copy over the budget, a `t()` key that does
not resolve, a glued `{t('x')}{value}` adjacency, or a hard-coded date format.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the full web unit suite**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm --filter=@breeze/web test --run
```
Expected: PASS. This is CI's `Test Web` job verbatim
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:698`). Note the missing `--` — `pnpm --filter … test
-- --run` forwards the literal token, vitest swallows `--run`, and the run never
exits watch mode.

- [ ] **Step 5: Check and build the docs**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs check
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs build
```
Expected: both PASS. These are the two run steps of CI's `docs-check` job
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:169-173`).

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the E2E spec against a live stack**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/toddhebebrand/.herdr/worktrees/breeze/outbound-email-domain
pnpm wt-stack up
pnpm wt-stack test -- tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts
pnpm wt-stack down
```
Expected: three tests PASS, then the stack is gone. Confirm nothing is left
behind — `pnpm wt-stack down` can silently no-op from the wrong worktree or
branch:
```bash
docker compose ls -a --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.ConfigFiles|test("breeze")) | "\(.Name)\t\(.Status)"'
```
Expected: no project from this worktree still running.

- [ ] **Step 7: Open the PR**

Branch `feature/6180-partner-sending-domains/wave-6185`, PR body
contains `Closes #6185`, the release-notes block from Task 14 under a
`## Release notes` heading, and a line stating that `portal-dev-e2e` is
non-blocking so the new spec is signal rather than a gate. `get_feature_status`
and `complete_wave` per the feature-lifecycle skill.

## Operator rollout checklist — NOT a Codex task

Everything below is done by a human against real infrastructure, after this
wave's PR has merged. It is recorded here because spec §16.1 and §14 are part of
what W05 delivers, and because the first three steps are what turn the feature on
for the first hosted partner. **No task above depends on any of it, and an
implementing agent must not attempt any of it.**

- [ ] **§16.1 step 1 — create the partner-lane provider accounts.** One Resend
  team per region (US, and EU created in `eu-west-1`), Pro plan, a `full_access`
  API key each. Add `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER`, `EMAIL_DOMAINS_RESEND_API_KEY`,
  `EMAIL_DOMAINS_REGION` and the caps to `/opt/breeze/.env` on **both**
  droplets, **and** map every one of them in the `api` (and `worker`) service
  `environment:` block of `/opt/breeze/docker-compose.yml`. A value in `.env`
  alone is inert. The hosted rule is enforced at boot: the partner-lane key must
  differ from `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `static` is refused when `IS_HOSTED=true`.

- [ ] **§16.1 step 2 — merge W01 through W05 with the provider still unset.**
  Nothing changes for any tenant: the tab is hidden, the routes 404, the worker
  is not registered, and W01's golden test is the proof that no rendered email
  moved.

- [ ] **§16.1 step 3 — turn it on for one partner.** Confirm
  `PARTNER_TRUST_MODE=enforce` on both regions. Set `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER` and
  an `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PARTNER_ALLOWLIST` containing OliveTech only. Verify with
  the version-parity enumeration from CLAUDE.md that both regions are actually
  running the release that contains W05 — `/health` cannot see a service that
  was never rolled.

- [ ] **§14 lab check — before any other partner is enabled.** On a
  LanternOps-owned subdomain, on the hosted partner-lane account:
  - add the domain through the tab, publish the records, watch it verify;
  - send a real customer-facing message and confirm `dkim=pass` with `header.d`
    equal to the partner domain, and a DMARC pass, at **both** Gmail and
    Microsoft 365;
  - reply to a ticket notification from the customer side and confirm the reply
    lands on the ticket;
  - delete the DKIM record and drill the whole degradation path:
    `verified` → `at_risk` (amber banner naming the record, mail still flowing)
    → `failed` → mail falling back to `EMAIL_FROM` with nothing lost.

- [ ] **Self-hosted smoke, `static` mode.** On a non-production self-hosted rig,
  set `EMAIL_DOMAINS_PROVIDER=static` and `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED` to a
  domain the relay may send as, add it, send the test that verifies it, set the
  `support` address, and confirm a ticket notification arrives from it. Then
  remove the domain from `EMAIL_DOMAINS_STATIC_ALLOWED`, restart, and confirm the
  row moves to failed and mail falls back to `EMAIL_FROM` rather than being lost.

## Self-review

Every row of the spec §10 state table, every §16.2 documentation bullet, and the
three blanket rules at the foot of §10, mapped to the task that delivers it and
the test that proves it.

### Spec §10 — web UI state table

| §10 row | Task | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| unsupported → tab hidden | 9, 10 | `domainView.test.ts` "hides the tab when this instance has no provider configured"; `PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx` "hides the tab when this instance has no provider configured" and "falls back to the Company tab when the hash names a tab this instance hides" |

| `failed` — Retry inside the window, and Remove | 3, 6 | `domainView.test.ts` `isInsideRetryWindow` — inside, outside, non-failed and unparseable cases; `DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx` "explains a failure and offers both Try again and Remove" plus "drops Try again once the 72-hour retry window has passed, keeping Remove". The window is measured from `statusChangedAt`; the server re-enforces it, so a click racing the boundary still surfaces the server error |
| `suspended` — contact support, no actions | 6 | `DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx` "offers no action at all on a suspended domain" |
| `removing` — disabled row | 6 | `DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx` "disables the row while it is being removed" |
| `lastSendError` display | 6 | `DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx` "shows the most recent delivery refusal whatever the status is" |
| "All mutations go through `runAction`" | 2, 11 | `sendingDomains.test.ts` toast and 401 assertions; `no-silent-mutations.test.ts` per-file check on the two new `TARGET_GLOBS` entries, with no allowlist entry |
| "New i18n keys get real translations in every shipped locale" | 1 | `localeParity.test.ts` (key sets, interpolation tokens, protected literals) and `translationCoverage.test.ts` (English-copy budget) across all eight locales |
| "Every interactive element has a `data-testid`" | 4–10 | every component test queries by `data-testid` only, as does the whole E2E spec |

### Other spec sections this wave owns

| Requirement | Task | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| §4.1 client-side validation uses the shared normaliser | 4 | `AddDomainForm.test.tsx` "normalises with the shared validator before calling onAdd" and "refuses a structurally invalid domain client-side" |
| §4.4 identity rules; the partner never types a full From address | 7 | `SenderIdentitiesForm.test.tsx` reserved / malformed local part, display-name spoof, Reply-To cases; the From address is composed and shown, never typed |
| §7 error codes map to specific copy (`409 domain_unavailable`, caps, rate limits) | 2 | `sendingDomains.test.ts` `sendingDomainFriendlyError` table and the 409 / 429 toast assertions |
| `provider_rejected` surfaces correctly in both modes | 3, 6 | `domainView.test.ts` static vs DNS branch; `DomainStatusPanel.test.tsx` both cases |
| Polling stops on unmount and when the tab is hidden | 9 | `PartnerSendingDomainTab.test.tsx` "stops polling on unmount" and "stops polling while the browser tab is hidden and resumes when it comes back" |
| UI state in `window.location.hash`, not a query param | 10 | `PartnerSettingsPage.sendingDomains.test.tsx` "mounts the tab from the URL hash…"; the tab reuses the page's existing `HASH_TO_TAB` mechanism |
| §14 E2E bullet — add → records → check → verified → configure `support` → test send → remove, plus not-eligible | 12 | `e2e-tests/tests/partner-sending-domains.spec.ts` test 1 and test 3 |
| §14 E2E — a `*.fail.test` path | 12 | same spec, test 2 |
| §16.1 rollout steps 1–3 and the §14 lab check | — | the operator checklist above, deliberately not a task |

### Spec §16.2 — self-hosted documentation bullets

| §16.2 bullet | Task | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| "Upgrading is a no-op" — three empty tables, no required variable, worker not registered, tab hidden, every email unchanged | 13, 14 | the `Aside` under the page intro, and the first paragraph of the release-notes block |
| Opting in on SMTP or Mailgun (`static`): set the two variables, restart, add the domain, send the test that verifies it, set `support` and `billing` | 13 | "Per-stream addresses on any relay", the four `Steps` |
| The precondition in one sentence — the relay must already be allowed to send as those addresses, with SPF/DKIM in place | 13 | the `Aside type="caution" title="The precondition, in one sentence"` |
| Opting in on Resend: a `full_access` key is needed, a sending-only key cannot manage domains, one account for both lanes is fine, a pre-existing domain is adopted and never deleted | 13 | "The DNS wizard", steps 1 and 3 plus the adoption paragraph |
| The docs page itself: under the deploy docs, linked from `deploy/environment.mdx`, three setups side by side, compose mapping lines | 13 | `deploy/custom-sender-addresses.mdx`; "Which setup you want"; "Mapping the variables into your containers"; the cross-link inserted at the end of `## Email` |
| Multi-partner instances: bind each `static` entry with `domain:partner-slug`; an unbound entry can be claimed by any partner | 13 | "Per-stream addresses on any relay", step 1 |
| §5.1 "listing a domain does not authorise it" | 13 | the bolded sentence directly under the precondition aside |
| §11 environment variable table | 13 | "Environment variables" |
| §2 what sharing one key trades away | 13 | "What sharing one Resend account trades away" |
| Partner-facing help: DNS records, the subdomain recommendation, where replies go | 13 | "What your technicians will see", three paragraphs |
| The release-notes / GitHub Release self-hoster callout | 14 | the ready-to-paste block, carried in the PR body to the release author |
