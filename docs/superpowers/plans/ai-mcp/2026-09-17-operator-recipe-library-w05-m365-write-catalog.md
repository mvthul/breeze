# Operator Recipe Library — Wave M1: M365 Graph identity write catalog, verification probes, permission profile v2, consent UX

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Eight new Microsoft 365 Graph write actions (`revoke_sessions`, `license.remove`, `license.assign`, `group.membership.remove`, `group.membership.add`, `intune.device.retire`, `user.create`, `user.mailbox.auto_reply`) are dispatchable end-to-end — from chat as ordinary Tier-3 four-eyes tools, and headlessly from the durable action-intents release worker — each with a typed read-side verification probe, a declared idempotency class, an app-role-aware refusal ladder, the `customer-graph-actions` permission profile bumped to v2 **once**, and a consent UX that tells the customer what v2 adds while v1 connections keep working for the two v1 actions.

**Architecture:** The wire contract stays schema-driven end to end. `packages/shared/src/m365/writeActions.ts` gains eight mutating arms plus one read-only *probe* arm on the same discriminated union, so the executor route (`POST /v1/execute-action`) and the internal-auth operation vocabulary are untouched. The actions executor's `MicrosoftGraphClient` gains `post` and `del` (it has only `readResource`/`readCollection`/`patch` today) and `executeGraphWriteAction` gains one `case` per action, each of which fails closed on a **pre-read** where the end state or the target's shape decides the answer (no license seat → `license_unavailable`; dynamic / role-assignable group → `unsupported_group_type`; already-not-a-member → `noop: true` with no DELETE). Verification runs on the READ side: seven of the eight probes are served by the `customer-graph-read` profile, which already holds every role they need, through a new org-keyed entry `executeM365ReadActionByOrg`; the eighth (auto-reply) cannot be — the read profile holds no `MailboxSettings.Read` — so it runs through the actions executor's probe arm. `services/m365ControlPlane/effectProbes.ts` exposes the single typed function the engine waves call, `probeM365Effect(actionId, args, ctx)`. `writeActionService` gains an app-role ladder that refuses a v2-only action on a v1 connection with the new typed code `consent_upgrade_required` (never `connection_not_ready`), and a `for-auth` entry so chat callers get the same ladder under their own RLS context. The web integrations card explains v2 in plain language, and a partner-scoped route lists every connection still on v1.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, zod (shared wire contracts), Hono (API + executor apps), Drizzle ORM, Vitest (unit + `vitest.integration.config.ts` against real Postgres), React + react-i18next (web).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-09-17-operator-recipe-library-design.md` — §7.1 (the eight actions, their Graph calls, app roles and classes), §7.2 (consent migration: one v2 bump, v1 keeps working, per-role readiness, partner view of v1 connections), §6.6 (probe → write → probe, idempotency classes, no executor-side dedup store), §4.1 (readiness inputs: `permission_manifest_version` against the profile version, `observed_grants` against required app roles), §10 row M1 (independent of E1–E4). Builds on `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-07-13-breeze-m365-control-plane-design.md` (§9.1 tiers, `m365.<domain>.<object>.<verb>` naming), `docs/superpowers/specs/integrations/2026-07-22-breeze-m365-customer-graph-actions-consent-design.md` (consent / re-consent path), `docs/superpowers/specs/ai-mcp/2026-07-19-m365-graph-actions-executor-design.md` (at-most-once, no dedup store).

**Feature tracking:** parent issue and wave sub-issue assigned by `register_feature` after all wave plans exist; branch `feature/<parent#>-operator-recipe-library/wave-<subissue#>`.

---

## Global Constraints

- **No database migration in this wave.** Every M1 change is code: the profile version and its required app roles live in `packages/shared/src/m365/profiles.ts`, and `m365_connections.permission_manifest_version` / `observed_grants` are existing columns written by the consent lifecycle. Therefore **no** `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER`, `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY`, `orgMergeRegistry.ts`, device/ticket org-move list, or `rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` edit applies. Do not invent one. If a later step appears to need a table, stop and report instead of adding a migration.
- **Rigor: high.** This is auth/consent/identity-destruction code. Every task is red-first: write the test, run it, *see it fail for the stated reason*, then implement, then run it green. A test that passes on first run is a defect in the test — fix the test before writing code.
- **Least privilege is a hard requirement (spec §7.1).** `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`, never `Group.ReadWrite.All`. Intune **retire** only — `POST …/retire`. The executor must contain **no** `/wipe` path, and Task 3's test asserts the string `/wipe` appears nowhere in `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/writeActions.ts`.
- **App-role GUIDs are NOT to be invented.** For each new role, open Microsoft's published permissions reference (`https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference`), copy the application-permission id, and record the source URL in a code comment beside it. Task 4 gives candidate GUIDs marked `VERIFY` — each one must be checked against that page before the commit, and the comment updated to say it was verified. `Organization.Read.All` = `498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6` is **already verified in-repo** (`packages/shared/src/m365/profiles.ts:159`, the `customer-graph-read` manifest) and may be copied as-is.
- **Registry sweep.** The complete set of places a new M365 write tool must be registered — established by `grep -rn 'm365_disable_user\|m365_reset_password' --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' .` and `grep -rn 'm365\.user\.disable' --include='*.ts' .` at planning time — is: `packages/shared/src/m365/writeActions.ts` (+`.test.ts`), `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/writeActions.ts` (+`.test.ts`), `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsM365.ts` (`m365ToolTiers` + handler), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.ts` (`TOOL_TIERS` + `m365ToolDefinitions`), `apps/api/src/services/aiGuardrails.ts` (`TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS` + `TOOL_PERMISSIONS`), `apps/api/src/services/m365ToolsHeadless.ts` (`M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS` + argument builder, parity test), `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/secretBearingTools.ts` (`SECRET_BEARING_TOOLS`), `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/resultSecrets.ts` (secret-bearing action ids), `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts` (`DELIBERATELY_UNPINNED`), `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdk.ts` (`M365_VERB` approval-card map), `apps/api/src/routes/approvals.ts` (`M365_MUTATION_TOOLS`), `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts` (+ its parity test `apps/api/src/services/aiGuardrailsTierConfig.parity.test.ts`), and `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/ApprovalHistoryFeed.tsx`. **Three files named in the brief need no list edit, only a comment refresh** — `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts` (dispatch is generic through `isHeadlessM365Tool`, line 1284-1285; only the prose at 1183-1190 names the two tools), `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts:713` (a comment above `M365_GRAPH_ACTIONS_TOOLS_ENABLED`), and `apps/mobile/src/services/approvals.ts:36-37` (a doc comment on `customerTenant`). **`apps/api/src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.ts` must NOT be edited** — see Decision 2.
- **`packages/shared/src/m365/executorContracts.test.ts` needs no edit.** It covers `completeConsentRequestSchema` / `retestRequestSchema` / `executorFailureCodeSchema` only; the write-action contracts are pinned by `writeActions.test.ts`. Its `VERIFIED_RESULT.manifestVersion: 2` literal is the **read** profile's consent result shape and is unrelated to the actions profile bump. Verified by reading the file; do not "fix" it.
- **Tests:** file beside source. One file: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/path/file.test.ts` (never `pnpm --filter … test -- --run`; never a trailing-slash directory filter). Shared: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/writeActions.test.ts`. Executors: `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/...`. Web: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/...`. Integration: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/<file>` with a live stack (`pnpm test-stack up` at repo root; `pnpm test-stack down` when finished — nothing does this for you). Integration tests live **only** under `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/`. A 0-test run is a stall, not green.
- **Typecheck:** `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`, plus `cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` and the same in each executor app after touching it.
- **i18n:** every new web string needs a real translation in all eight locale directories — `apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/integrations.json`. English copied into another locale is a failure.
- **Web mutations go through `runAction`** (`apps/web/src/lib/runAction.ts`); selected tab/row state uses `window.location.hash`, never a query param.
- **No secrets in logs, audit details or metrics.** `recordM365WriteActionEvent`'s `details` allowlist stays `{ actionType, outcome }`. The `m365.user.create` temporary password follows the `m365.user.reset_password` sealing path byte for byte.
- **Commits:** end every commit message with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Final task opens the PR with `Closes #<wave sub-issue>` and **STOPS** — never merge.

## Decisions recorded for the orchestrator

1. **The auto-reply probe runs on the ACTIONS executor, not the read executor.** `customer-graph-read` v3 (`profiles.ts:105-119`) holds no `MailboxSettings.Read`, so a read-side auto-reply probe would force a **second** re-consent on a second app registration — exactly what spec §7.2 ("v2 once, not once per action") forbids. The actions profile already needs `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite`, which subsumes the read. It therefore ships as a read-only arm on the write union (`m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply.state`) dispatched through the existing `/v1/execute-action` route. Consequences, all accepted and made explicit in code comments: it consumes the **write** budget, and it writes a `m365.customer_graph_actions.action_executed` audit row with `outcome: 'ok'`. The union member is exported as `M365_PROBE_ACTION_IDS`, kept **out of** `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS` and out of `M365WriteActionId`, so a probe can never be reached by a tool, an intent, or `M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS` (whose value type is `M365WriteActionId`).
2. **The eight tools are session-only, exactly like `m365_disable_user`.** They go in `m365ToolTiers` (tier 3) and are declared in `m365ToolDefinitions()` with `makeSessionAwareHandler`; they are **not** registered into the shared `aiTools` map and therefore get **no** `agentToolCatalog.ts` `TOOL_CAPABILITY` entry and **no** `aiToolSchemasM365.ts` entry. This is forced by a real contract, not taste: `agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts:20-46` asserts (a) `Object.keys(TOOL_CAPABILITY) === [...aiTools.keys()]` exactly and (b) every registered tool that is in `TOOL_TIERS` is agent-reachable, while `listAgentReachableTools()` (`agentToolCatalog.ts:365-374`) excludes everything in `m365ToolTiers` via `isSessionOnly`. Registry membership and `m365ToolTiers` membership are mutually exclusive by construction, and the headless parity test (`m365ToolsHeadless.test.ts:33-36`) pins `keys(M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS) === tier-3 m365ToolTiers`. Being session-only costs the recipe nothing: the Operator coordinator mints action intents and the durable release worker dispatches them through `executeM365ToolHeadless` (spec §6.1 "reserve operation → mint or attach intent → dispatch via release worker"); the model never calls these tools.
3. **The handlers do not use the session.** Unlike the Delegant-backed `m365DisableUserHandler`, the new handlers take the org from `auth`/`input.orgId` and call the control-plane path (`executeM365WriteActionForAuth`). The `sessionId` parameter is accepted and ignored, so the `makeSessionAwareHandler` signature still fits. Delegant is not involved in any new action.
4. **The write budget is raised from 10/min · 100/day to 30/min · 300/day** (`writeActionBudget.ts:27-28`). One offboarding fans out ~9 M365 effects plus auto-reply probes inside a minute; at 10/min the recipe would rate-limit itself on its own first run.
5. **`consent_upgrade_required` refuses only on an authoritative observation.** The ladder refuses when `grantsVerifiedAt !== null` **and** a required role for the requested action is absent from `observed_grants`. When `grantsVerifiedAt === null` the connection has no authoritative grant observation and the call falls through to today's behaviour (attempt, and let Graph answer `graph_permission_missing`). Without that guard a never-reconciled v1 connection would start refusing `m365.user.disable`, which is precisely the "v1 keeps working" promise being broken.
6. **`unsupported_group_type` is decided by a pre-read inside the executor**, before any `DELETE`/`POST`. A group is unsupported when `groupTypes` contains `DynamicMembership` or `isAssignableToRole === true`. If the pre-read itself fails with `graph_permission_missing`, the action fails closed with that code and still issues no membership call. (`GroupMember.ReadWrite.All` is documented to allow listing groups and reading basic group properties — confirm in the lab run, Task 14; if it cannot read `isAssignableToRole`, the fix is a v3 bump adding `Group.Read.All`, filed as a follow-up, **not** a silent skip of the check.)
7. **`m365.user.license.assign` seat check is a pre-read of `/subscribedSkus`,** not a reaction to Graph's 400. Graph's "not enough licenses" surfaces as a generic `Request_BadRequest`, which is indistinguishable from a malformed body. Reading `prepaidUnits.enabled - consumedUnits <= 0` for each requested SKU and refusing with `license_unavailable` before the `POST` is deterministic, testable, and is what "fails closed on no available seat" means. This is why the actions profile needs `Organization.Read.All`.

### Task 1 — Graph client gains `post` and `del` on the actions executor

**Files**
- `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/graphClient.ts` (558 lines; `MicrosoftGraphClient` at :40-63 has `probeTenant`, `readResource`, `readCollection`, `patch` only; `patch`'s implementation is :526-556)
- `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/graphClient.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* `readBoundedBody`, `readFailure`, `graphUrl`, `failure`, `GraphClientError` (all already in the file).
- *Produces:*
  ```ts
  post(input: { accessToken: OpaqueAccessToken; path: string; body: Record<string, unknown> }): Promise<Record<string, unknown> | null>;
  del(input: { accessToken: OpaqueAccessToken; path: string }): Promise<void>;
  ```
  `post` returns the parsed JSON body when the response has one (Graph answers `201 Created` with the new user object for `POST /users`) and `null` on `204 No Content`. Named `del`, not `delete` — `delete` is a reserved word as a bare method name in some downstream mock object literals and reads badly at call sites.

**Steps**
- [ ] Add failing tests to `graphClient.test.ts`, mirroring the existing `patch` describe block:
  - `post` sends `method: 'POST'`, `content-type: application/json`, the serialized body, `redirect: 'error'`, and an `authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
  - `post` returns the parsed object on a 201 with a JSON body.
  - `post` returns `null` on a 204 with no body.
  - `post` maps 403 → `graph_permission_missing`, 404 → `graph_not_found`, 429 → `graph_throttled` with `retryAfterSeconds` from the `retry-after` header, other non-2xx → `graph_provider_rejected` (i.e. it goes through `readFailure`, exactly as `patch` does).
  - `post` maps an aborted request to `graph_request_timeout` and a thrown fetch to `graph_transport_failed`.
  - `post` rejects a path not starting with `/` with `graph_request_invalid`.
  - `del` sends `method: 'DELETE'` with no body, resolves on 204, and maps failures identically.
  - `del` treats **404 as a thrown `graph_not_found`** (the caller decides whether that is a no-op, not the transport).
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/microsoft/graphClient.test.ts` — expect `post is not a function` / `del is not a function`.
- [ ] Extract the shared mutation body of `patch` into a local `async function mutate(method: 'PATCH' | 'POST' | 'DELETE', input, body?): Promise<string>` that returns the (bounded) response text, and re-implement `patch` on top of it so its behaviour is provably unchanged. Add `post` (parses the returned text as JSON when non-empty, else `null`) and `del` on top of the same helper. Keep the `configValid` / `accessToken` / `path.startsWith('/')` guard at the top of each public method.
- [ ] Add `post` and `del` to the `MicrosoftGraphClient` interface at :40-63.
- [ ] Run green: `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/microsoft/graphClient.test.ts` (the pre-existing `patch` tests must still pass — that is the regression proof).
- [ ] `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`
- [ ] Commit: `feat(m365-actions-executor): add post/del to the Graph client for the identity write catalog`

### Task 2 — Shared write-action contract: eight mutating arms, one probe arm, idempotency and required-role maps

**Files**
- `packages/shared/src/m365/writeActions.ts` (79 lines today)
- `packages/shared/src/m365/writeActions.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* nothing new.
- *Produces:* the exported surface listed above, plus the widened `m365WriteActionSchema` / `writeActionResultSchema` / `writeActionFailureCodeSchema`.

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing contract test first, in `packages/shared/src/m365/writeActions.test.ts`. Replace the existing `it('pins the action id list')` with:
  ```ts
  it('pins the mutating action id list', () => {
    expect([...M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS]).toEqual([
      'm365.user.disable',
      'm365.user.reset_password',
      'm365.user.revoke_sessions',
      'm365.user.license.remove',
      'm365.user.license.assign',
      'm365.group.membership.remove',
      'm365.group.membership.add',
      'm365.intune.device.retire',
      'm365.user.create',
      'm365.user.mailbox.auto_reply',
    ]);
  });

  it('pins the probe action id list and keeps it disjoint from the write ids', () => {
    expect([...M365_PROBE_ACTION_IDS]).toEqual(['m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply.state']);
    for (const id of M365_PROBE_ACTION_IDS) {
      expect((M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS as readonly string[]).includes(id)).toBe(false);
    }
  });

  it('classifies every mutating action for idempotency', () => {
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDEMPOTENCY).toEqual({
      'm365.user.disable': 'idempotent',
      'm365.user.reset_password': 'non_idempotent',
      'm365.user.revoke_sessions': 'idempotent',
      'm365.user.license.remove': 'idempotent',
      'm365.user.license.assign': 'idempotent_by_probe',
      'm365.group.membership.remove': 'idempotent',
      'm365.group.membership.add': 'idempotent',
      'm365.intune.device.retire': 'idempotent',
      'm365.user.create': 'non_idempotent',
      'm365.user.mailbox.auto_reply': 'idempotent_by_probe',
    });
    expect(Object.keys(M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDEMPOTENCY).sort())
      .toEqual([...M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS].sort());
  });

  it('names the app roles every executor action needs', () => {
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.user.disable']).toEqual(['User.ReadWrite.All']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.user.reset_password'])
      .toEqual(['User.ReadWrite.All', 'User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.user.license.assign'])
      .toEqual(['User.ReadWrite.All', 'Organization.Read.All']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.group.membership.remove'])
      .toEqual(['GroupMember.ReadWrite.All']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.intune.device.retire'])
      .toEqual(['DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply'])
      .toEqual(['MailboxSettings.ReadWrite']);
    expect(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES['m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply.state'])
      .toEqual(['MailboxSettings.ReadWrite']);
    expect(Object.keys(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES).sort())
      .toEqual([...M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS, ...M365_PROBE_ACTION_IDS].sort());
  });
  ```
  and add parse tests: every new arm accepts a minimal valid payload, rejects an extra key (`.strict()`), rejects a missing `reason` on each mutating arm, rejects a `skuIds` array of length 0 and of length 21, rejects a non-GUID `groupId`, rejects a `usageLocation` of `'USA'` (must be exactly two letters), rejects an `autoReply` arm whose `status` is `'scheduled'` but which omits `scheduledStartDateTime`, and — for the result schema — accepts one success body per arm and rejects `{ success: true, action: 'm365.user.create', userId: UUID }` without `temporaryPassword`.
- [ ] Run red: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/writeActions.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement. Add these local schemas above `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS`:
  ```ts
  const skuIdsSchema = z.array(guidSchema).min(1).max(20);
  const displayTextSchema = z.string().min(1).max(256);
  // Exchange auto-reply bodies are HTML-capable and can be long; bounded so a
  // request can never exceed the executor's 16 KiB body cap (app.ts:18).
  const replyBodySchema = z.string().min(1).max(4000);
  const isoInstantSchema = z.string().datetime();
  // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. Graph rejects anything else, and a license cannot be
  // assigned to a user with no usageLocation.
  const usageLocationSchema = z.string().regex(/^[A-Z]{2}$/);
  ```
- [ ] Replace the id list with the two exported lists and the derived types:
  ```ts
  export const M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS = [
    'm365.user.disable',
    'm365.user.reset_password',
    'm365.user.revoke_sessions',
    'm365.user.license.remove',
    'm365.user.license.assign',
    'm365.group.membership.remove',
    'm365.group.membership.add',
    'm365.intune.device.retire',
    'm365.user.create',
    'm365.user.mailbox.auto_reply',
  ] as const;

  /**
   * Read-only arms carried on the SAME executor union and route as the writes.
   * Why they are not read-executor actions: the `customer-graph-read` profile
   * holds no MailboxSettings.Read, and adding it would force a SECOND customer
   * re-consent on a second app registration — which the consent migration
   * (spec §7.2) exists to avoid. Kept out of M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS so a probe
   * id can never be an AI tool target, an action-intent action name, or a

  **Note for the implementer:** `z.discriminatedUnion` rejects a `ZodEffects` member, so the `.refine()`d auto-reply arm cannot sit inside the `discriminatedUnion` call. Build the union from the plain `.strict()` objects and apply the cross-field rule with a single `.superRefine` on the union instead:
  ```ts
  export const m365WriteActionSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('type', [ /* …plain arms… */ ])
    .superRefine((value, ctx) => {
      if (value.type === 'm365.user.mailbox.auto_reply'
        && value.status === 'scheduled'
        && (value.scheduledStartDateTime === undefined || value.scheduledEndDateTime === undefined)) {
        ctx.addIssue({
          code: z.ZodIssueCode.custom,
          message: 'scheduled auto-reply requires scheduledStartDateTime and scheduledEndDateTime',
        });
      }
    });
  ```
- [ ] Add the new failure codes to `writeActionFailureCodeSchema`, after `invalid_action`:
  ```ts

    // determined by a /subscribedSkus pre-read — NO assignLicense call was made.
    'license_unavailable',
    // The group is dynamic-membership or role-assignable, so its members are not
    // directly editable. Determined by a group pre-read — NO members call was made.
    'unsupported_group_type',
    // The Intune managedDevice id does not resolve. Distinct from user_not_found
    // so a probe can tell "wrong device" from "wrong user".
    'device_not_found',
    // POST /users rejected the principal: the UPN is taken, or its domain is not
    // a verified domain on the tenant.
    'user_already_exists',
  ```
- [ ] Extend `writeActionResultSchema` with one success arm per new action (keep the failure arm last):
  ```ts
    z.object({ success: z.literal(true), action: z.literal('m365.user.revoke_sessions'), userId: guidSchema }).strict(),
    z.object({
      success: z.literal(true), action: z.literal('m365.user.license.remove'),
      userId: guidSchema, removedSkuIds: z.array(guidSchema), noop: z.boolean(),
    }).strict(),

- [ ] Commit: `feat(shared): M365 identity write catalog contract — 8 mutating actions, 1 probe arm, idempotency + role maps`

---

### Task 3 — Executor: implement the eight writes and the probe, with fail-closed pre-reads

**Files**
- `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/writeActions.ts` (100 lines today)
- `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/writeActions.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* `MicrosoftGraphClient.post/del/patch/readResource/readCollection` (Task 1), the widened `M365WriteAction` / `WriteActionResult` (Task 2), the existing `resolveUserId` and `mapGraphFailure`.
- *Produces:* `executeGraphWriteAction` handling every arm; a new exported `resolveUserIdentifier(identifier, ctx)` (the existing `resolveUserId` generalised to take a string, since several arms resolve a user that is not `action.userIdentifier`-shaped at the type level).

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing tests first in `writeActions.test.ts`, using the existing fake-graph-client style in that file. **Every one of these is a required test:**
  1. `revoke_sessions` resolves the user then `POST /users/{id}/revokeSignInSessions` with an empty body, and returns `{ success: true, action, userId }`.
  2. `license.remove` issues `POST /users/{id}/assignLicense` with `{ addLicenses: [], removeLicenses: [<skuIds>] }` and returns `removedSkuIds` equal to the requested ids, `noop: false`.
  3. `license.remove` **pre-reads** `/users/{id}?$select=id,assignedLicenses`; when none of the requested SKUs is assigned it returns `noop: true`, `removedSkuIds: []`, and **issues no POST** (assert the fake client recorded zero `post` calls).
  4. `license.assign` pre-reads `/subscribedSkus`; when the requested SKU has `prepaidUnits.enabled - consumedUnits <= 0` it returns `{ success: false, errorCode: 'license_unavailable' }` and **issues no POST**.
  5. `license.assign` pre-reads `/users/{id}?$select=id,assignedLicenses`; when the SKU is already assigned it returns `noop: true` and issues no POST (this is what makes it `idempotent_by_probe`).
  6. `license.assign` with a free seat issues `POST /users/{id}/assignLicense` with `{ addLicenses: [{ skuId, disabledPlans }], removeLicenses: [] }`.
  7. `group.membership.remove` pre-reads `/groups/{gid}?$select=id,groupTypes,isAssignableToRole`; a group whose `groupTypes` contains `'DynamicMembership'` returns `{ success: false, errorCode: 'unsupported_group_type' }` with **zero `del` calls**.
  8. Same for `isAssignableToRole: true`.
  9. `group.membership.remove` on a supported group where the member is absent (membership pre-read returns an empty collection) returns `{ success: true, …, noop: true }` with **zero `del` calls**.
  10. `group.membership.remove` on a present member issues `DELETE /groups/{gid}/members/{uid}/$ref` and returns `noop: false`.
  11. `group.membership.remove` where the `DELETE` itself throws `graph_not_found` returns `{ success: true, …, noop: true }` — a concurrent removal is the desired end state, not a failure.
  12. `group.membership.add` on a member who is already present returns `noop: true` with zero `post` calls; on an absent member it issues `POST /groups/{gid}/members/$ref` with body `{ '@odata.id': 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/{uid}' }`.
  13. `group.membership.add` where the `POST` fails with a Graph `graph_provider_rejected` returns `{ success: false, errorCode: 'graph_error' }` (no silent success).
  14. `intune.device.retire` issues `POST /deviceManagement/managedDevices/{id}/retire` with an empty body; a 404 on that call maps to `device_not_found`, not `user_not_found`.
  15. `intune.device.retire` never constructs a `/wipe` path — assert `readFileSync(<writeActions.ts>, 'utf8').includes('/wipe') === false`.
  16. `user.create` issues `POST /users` with `accountEnabled: true`, `displayName`, `mailNickname`, `userPrincipalName`, `usageLocation`, and `passwordProfile: { forceChangePasswordNextSignIn: true, password: <generated> }`; returns `{ success: true, action, userId, userPrincipalName, temporaryPassword, forceChangeNextSignIn: true }` where `temporaryPassword` is 20 chars and is **not** any input value.
  17. `user.create` where the `POST` fails with a 400-class `graph_provider_rejected` returns `{ success: false, errorCode: 'user_already_exists' }`. (Rationale comment: `POST /users` has exactly two 400-class causes we can act on — a taken UPN and an unverified domain — and the request body is schema-validated before it leaves the API, so a 400 here is a principal conflict.)
  18. `user.create` does **no** pre-read and is never retried internally (assert exactly one `post` call on both the success and failure paths).
  19. `mailbox.auto_reply` issues `PATCH /users/{id}/mailboxSettings` with `{ automaticRepliesSetting: { status, externalAudience, internalReplyMessage, externalReplyMessage, scheduledStartDateTime: { dateTime, timeZone: 'UTC' }, scheduledEndDateTime: { … } } }`, omitting absent optional keys entirely.
  20. `mailbox.auto_reply.state` issues `readResource` on `/users/{id}/mailboxSettings` selecting `automaticRepliesSetting` and returns the projected probe result, with `hasInternalReplyMessage` / `hasExternalReplyMessage` booleans and **no message body** anywhere in the returned object (assert with `JSON.stringify(result).includes('<the fixture body text>') === false`).
  21. Every arm maps `GraphClientError('graph_throttled', 42)` to `{ success: false, errorCode: 'graph_throttled', retryAfterSeconds: 42 }` (drive this as a table-driven loop over all ten action ids).
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/microsoft/writeActions.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement. Generalise the existing resolver and keep the old name as a thin wrapper so the two shipped arms are untouched:
  ```ts
  export async function resolveUserIdentifier(identifier: string, ctx: GraphWriteActionContext): Promise<string> {
    const resource = await ctx.graphClient.readResource({
      accessToken: ctx.accessToken,
      path: `/users/${encodeURIComponent(identifier)}`,
      select: ['id'],
    });
    const id = resource.id;
    if (typeof id !== 'string' || !id) throw new GraphClientError('graph_not_found');
    return id;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add `mapGraphFailure` cases: `graph_license_required` → `graph_error` (the actions app never expects it), and add a second optional parameter `notFoundCode: WriteActionFailureCode = 'user_not_found'` so the Intune arm can pass `'device_not_found'`.
- [ ] Add one `case` per arm inside the existing `switch`. Keep the `default: { const exhaustive: never = action; … }` guard — it is the compile-time proof that every arm is handled.
- [ ] Add the three pre-read helpers above `executeGraphWriteAction`, each with a comment stating **why** it exists (spec §6.6 probe-before-write; fail closed):
  ```ts
  async function assignedSkuIds(userId: string, ctx: GraphWriteActionContext): Promise<Set<string>>;
  async function availableSeatSkuIds(skuIds: readonly string[], ctx: GraphWriteActionContext): Promise<Set<string>>;
  async function groupIsDirectlyEditable(groupId: string, ctx: GraphWriteActionContext): Promise<boolean>;
  async function isDirectMember(groupId: string, userId: string, ctx: GraphWriteActionContext): Promise<boolean>;
  ```
  `isDirectMember` uses `readCollection` on `/groups/{gid}/members` with `query: { '$select': 'id', '$filter': `id eq '${userId}'`, '$count': 'true' }`, `consistencyLevelEventual: true`, `maxItems: 1`, `maxPages: 1`. Record the Microsoft advanced-query doc URL (`https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries`) in the comment. `userId` here is always a canonical GUID returned by `resolveUserIdentifier`, so splicing it into `$filter` is safe — say so in the comment, mirroring the note at `apps/m365-graph-read-executor/src/microsoft/readActions.ts:25-32`.

### Task 4 — `customer-graph-actions` profile v2 (one bump, all M1 roles)

**Files**
- `packages/shared/src/m365/profiles.ts` (:188-217 is the actions manifest)
- `packages/shared/src/m365/profiles.test.ts`
- `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/reconcile.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* nothing new. *Produces:* `M365_PERMISSION_PROFILES['customer-graph-actions'].version === 2` and five new `applicationPermissionAssignments`.

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing test in `profiles.test.ts`:
  ```ts
  it('customer-graph-actions is v2 and carries every M1 app role exactly once', () => {
    const profile = getM365PermissionProfile('customer-graph-actions');
    expect(profile.version).toBe(2);
    expect([...profile.applicationPermissions].sort()).toEqual([
      'DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All',
      'GroupMember.ReadWrite.All',
      'MailboxSettings.ReadWrite',
      'Organization.Read.All',
      'User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All',
      'User.ReadWrite.All',
    ]);
    const assignments = profile.applicationPermissionAssignments ?? [];
    expect(assignments.map((g) => g.value).sort()).toEqual([...profile.applicationPermissions].sort());
    expect(new Set(assignments.map((g) => g.appRoleId)).size).toBe(assignments.length);
    for (const grant of assignments) {
      expect(grant.resourceApplicationId).toBe('00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000');
      expect(grant.appRoleId).toMatch(/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/);
    }
  });

  it('never requests Group.ReadWrite.All (least privilege, spec §7.1)', () => {
    expect(getM365PermissionProfile('customer-graph-actions').applicationPermissions)
      .not.toContain('Group.ReadWrite.All');
  });

  it('every role M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES names is in the v2 manifest', () => {
    const held = new Set(getM365PermissionProfile('customer-graph-actions').applicationPermissions);
    for (const roles of Object.values(M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES)) {
      for (const role of roles) expect(held.has(role)).toBe(true);
    }
  });

  it('reports every v1 connection as needing consent reconciliation', () => {
    expect(connectionNeedsConsentReconciliation('customer-graph-actions', 1)).toBe(true);
    expect(connectionNeedsConsentReconciliation('customer-graph-actions', 2)).toBe(false);
  });
  ```
- [ ] Run red: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/profiles.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement: set `version: 2`, delete the roadmap comment block at :199-203, and write a v2 rationale comment in the style of the `customer-graph-read` v3 comment above it — naming Operator Recipe Library M1, saying the bump is **once for the whole identity catalog** so customers re-consent once, and stating the `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All` over `Group.ReadWrite.All` choice and the retire-only Intune choice.
- [ ] Add the five roles to `applicationPermissions` and the five assignments to `applicationPermissionAssignments`. **Before committing, open `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference`, find each permission's application-permission id, and confirm or correct these candidates; then change the comment from `VERIFY` to `verified against <url> on <date>`:**
  ```ts
  {
    resourceApplicationId: MICROSOFT_GRAPH_RESOURCE_APPLICATION_ID,
    // VERIFY against https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference
    // (search "GroupMember.ReadWrite.All", Application id) before commit.
    appRoleId: '62a82d76-70ea-41e2-9197-370581804d09',
    value: 'GroupMember.ReadWrite.All',
  },
  {
    resourceApplicationId: MICROSOFT_GRAPH_RESOURCE_APPLICATION_ID,
    // VERIFY — https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference
    appRoleId: '5b07b0dd-2377-4e44-a38d-703f09a0dc3c',
    value: 'DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All',
  },
  {

    appRoleId: '6931bccd-447a-43d1-b442-00a195474933',
    value: 'MailboxSettings.ReadWrite',
  },
  {
    resourceApplicationId: MICROSOFT_GRAPH_RESOURCE_APPLICATION_ID,
    // Verified in-repo: identical GUID to the customer-graph-read manifest above.
    appRoleId: '498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6',
    value: 'Organization.Read.All',
  },
  ```
  (`User.ReadWrite.All` and `User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All` stay exactly as they are — do not touch their GUIDs.)
- [ ] Run green: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/profiles.test.ts src/m365/writeActions.test.ts`
- [ ] Add a reconcile test in `apps/m365-graph-actions-executor/src/microsoft/reconcile.test.ts`: an observation whose `observedGrants` are only the two v1 grants reconciles to `outcome: 'missing'` with `missingGrants` naming the four new roles and `manifestVersion: 2`. Run: `cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/microsoft/reconcile.test.ts`.
- [ ] Commit: `feat(shared): bump customer-graph-actions permission profile to v2 with the full M1 role set`

    const v2 = getM365PermissionProfile('customer-graph-actions');

    it('reports true only for roles present in observed_grants', () => {

- [ ] Implement `m365RoleReadiness` in `connectionService.ts`, directly beneath `deriveGrantHealth`:
  ```ts
  /**
   * Per-app-role readiness from `observed_grants` (spec §4.1, §7.2): the input
   * the recipe library uses to degrade an effect to a human-work step instead of
   * failing a whole task. Keyed by role VALUE so callers name roles the way the
   * manifest and Microsoft's consent screen do.
   *
   * `grantsVerifiedAt === null` means no authoritative observation exists, and
   * every role reports false. Callers must NOT turn that into a refusal on its
   * own — see the ladder in writeActionService.

  ```
- [ ] In `writeActionService.ts`:
  - Add `'consent_upgrade_required'` to `M365WriteActionRefusalCode`, and widen it with `'site_scope_denied' | 'org_context_required'` for the auth entry.
  - Add the ladder step **between** the readiness check (line 119-130) and the budget check (132):
    ```ts
    // Spec §7.2: a v1 connection keeps working for the v1 actions; a v2-only
    // action refuses with its OWN code so the UI can offer re-consent instead
    // of telling the operator the tenant is disconnected. Only refuses on an
    // AUTHORITATIVE observation (grantsVerifiedAt set) — a never-reconciled
    // connection falls through and lets Graph answer, which is what keeps
    // every shipped v1 connection executing unchanged.
    if (ready.grantsVerifiedAt !== null) {
      const readiness = m365RoleReadiness(ready, getM365PermissionProfile(PROFILE));
      const missing = (M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES[action.type] ?? [])

          ok: false,
          code: 'consent_upgrade_required',

        };
      }
    }
    ```
  - Add `'consent_upgrade_required'` to `M365WriteActionOutcome` in `writeActionMetrics.ts` and widen the three `M365WriteActionId` occurrences there to `M365ExecutorActionId`.
  - Add `executeM365WriteActionForAuth`, which does the site/org/context work and then delegates to the existing function body:
    ```ts
    /**
     * Chat-path entry for the typed Graph write actions. Mirrors
     * readActionService.executeM365ReadAction's ladder (site scope -> org
     * resolution -> own RLS context) and then runs the same ladder as

    ```
  - Add `license_unavailable`, `unsupported_group_type`, `device_not_found`, `user_already_exists` to `FAILURE_MESSAGES` (the record is total over `WriteActionFailureCode`, so `tsc` fails without them):
    ```ts
    license_unavailable: 'No Microsoft 365 licence seat is available for the requested subscription.',
    unsupported_group_type: 'This group\'s membership is managed by Microsoft 365 (dynamic or role-assignable) and cannot be edited directly.',

    user_already_exists: 'A Microsoft 365 user already exists with that sign-in name, or its domain is not verified on this tenant.',
    ```
- [ ] Raise the budget constants to `30` / `300` with a comment naming the offboarding fan-out (~9 effects plus probes in one minute) as the reason.
- [ ] Run green: the three test files above, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ControlPlane/`
- [ ] Commit: `feat(api): M365 write ladder gains a per-role consent check and an auth-scoped entry`

### Task 6 — Read-side probe surface: new read action and projection fields

**Files**
- `packages/shared/src/m365/readActions.ts` (:13-19 id list, :55-67 field map, :127-179 branches)
- `packages/shared/src/m365/readActions.test.ts`
- `apps/m365-graph-read-executor/src/microsoft/readActions.ts` (:84-262 switch)
- `apps/m365-graph-read-executor/src/microsoft/readActions.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* the read executor's `MicrosoftGraphClient` (`readCollection` already supports `consistencyLevelEventual`).
- *Produces:* read action id `m365.group.member.get`; `m365.user.get` also projects `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime`.

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing tests first.

  In `packages/shared/src/m365/readActions.test.ts`:
  - `M365_INTERACTIVE_READ_ACTION_IDS` contains `'m365.group.member.get'` (appended after `'m365.group.members.list'`).
  - `M365_READ_ACTION_FIELDS['m365.group.member.get']` equals `['id', 'displayName', 'userPrincipalName', 'mail']`.
  - `M365_READ_ACTION_FIELDS['m365.user.get']` contains `'signInSessionsValidFromDateTime'`.
  - The schema accepts `{ type: 'm365.group.member.get', groupId: GUID, userId: GUID }` and rejects a non-GUID `userId`, an extra key, and a missing `userId`.

  In `apps/m365-graph-read-executor/src/microsoft/readActions.test.ts`:
  - `m365.group.member.get` calls `readCollection` with `path: '/groups/<gid>/members'`, `query['$filter'] === "id eq '<uid>'"`, `query['$count'] === 'true'`, `consistencyLevelEventual: true`, `maxItems: 1`, `maxPages: 1`.
  - It returns `{ success: true, kind: 'collection', items: [], truncated: false }` when the member is absent, and a one-item collection when present.
  - `m365.user.get` selects `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime` (assert the `select` array passed to `readResource`).
- [ ] Run red: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/readActions.test.ts` and `cd apps/m365-graph-read-executor && npx vitest run src/microsoft/readActions.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement in shared: append `'m365.group.member.get'` to `M365_INTERACTIVE_READ_ACTION_IDS`; add the field entry; add `'signInSessionsValidFromDateTime'` to the end of the `m365.user.get` field list with a comment — *"the only observable evidence that a session revoke landed: Graph exposes no 'sessions are gone' fact, only the instant before which tokens are invalid (spec §6.6)"*; add the branch:
  ```ts
  z.object({
    type: z.literal('m365.group.member.get'),
    groupId: guidSchema,
    // Always a canonical object id (never a UPN): a probe addresses the
    // immutable id the effect was dispatched against.
    userId: guidSchema,
  }).strict(),
  ```
- [ ] Implement in the read executor: a `case 'm365.group.member.get'` returning `projectedCollection(...)` exactly as described in the test. Keep the `never` exhaustiveness default.
- [ ] Run green: both test files, plus `cd apps/m365-graph-read-executor && npx vitest run src/ && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`, plus `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/`.
- [ ] Commit: `feat(m365-read-executor): targeted group-membership read and revoke-sessions evidence field for effect probes`

---

### Task 7 — `executeM365ReadActionByOrg` (org-keyed read entry for probes)

**Files**
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/readActionService.ts` (add beside `executeM365ReadAction` at :336)
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/readActionService.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* `connectionExecutionSnapshot` (:124), `callGraphReadExecutor` (:217), `isM365GraphReadToolsEnabledForOrg`, `connectionNotReadyState`.
- *Produces:*
  ```ts
  export async function executeM365ReadActionByOrg(
    orgId: string,
    action: M365InteractiveReadAction,
    opts?: { actorId?: string },
  ): Promise<M365ReadActionServiceResult>;
  ```

**Steps**
- [ ] Failing tests in `readActionService.test.ts`:
  - refuses `tools_disabled` when the org flag is off, without touching the database;
  - refuses `connection_not_ready` when no `customer-graph-read` row exists;
  - loads the connection under the **ambient** context — assert `withDbAccessContext` is NOT called and `withSystemDbAccessContext` is NOT called (this mirrors `executeM365WriteActionByOrg`'s contract at `writeActionService.ts:74-97`, and is why a probe caller must already hold a context);
  - refuses a sync action id with `tools_disabled` (`isM365SyncActionId` guard);
  - on a ready connection, calls `callGraphReadExecutor` with `route: 'read'` and the passed `actorId`.
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ControlPlane/readActionService.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement. Copy the body of `executeM365ReadAction` from the flag check onward, dropping the `auth`/site/org-resolution prologue and replacing the `withDbAccessContext(...)` wrapper with a bare `db.select()`, with this header comment:
  ```ts
  /**
   * Org-keyed read entry, for callers that already hold a db access context and
   * have no live auth — the Operator's effect probes (effectProbes.ts) and any
   * background verification. Mirrors writeActionService.executeM365WriteActionByOrg
   * exactly: the connection load runs under the AMBIENT context, never a system
   * context, because a contextless read is a denial rather than a bypass and a
   * system context would bypass RLS outright.
   */
  ```
- [ ] Run green; then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ControlPlane/`
- [ ] Commit: `feat(api): org-keyed M365 Graph read entry for effect verification probes`

---

### Task 8 — `effectProbes.ts`: `probeM365Effect`

**Files**
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/effectProbes.ts` (new)
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/effectProbes.test.ts` (new)

**Interfaces**
- *Consumes:* `executeM365ReadActionByOrg` (Task 7), `executeM365WriteActionByOrg` (for the auto-reply probe arm only), `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDEMPOTENCY`, `M365WriteAction`.
- *Produces:* `M365EffectProbeState`, `M365EffectProbeResult`, `M365EffectProbeContext`, `probeM365Effect` (signatures in "Exported surface" above).

**The eight criteria, verbatim — this table is the contract the engine waves read:**

| Action | Probe call | `satisfied` when | `unsatisfied` when | `unknown` when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `m365.user.revoke_sessions` | `m365.user.get` on `userIdentifier` | `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime` parses and is `>= ctx.effectRequestedAt` | it parses and is `< effectRequestedAt`, or is absent from the projection | any read refusal/failure |
| `m365.user.license.remove` | `m365.user.get` | none of `skuIds` appears in `assignedLicenses[].skuId` | any does | read failed, or `assignedLicenses` absent |
| `m365.user.license.assign` | `m365.user.get` | every `skuId` appears in `assignedLicenses[].skuId` | any is missing | as above |
| `m365.group.membership.remove` | `m365.group.member.get` | the collection is empty | the collection has an item | read failed |
| `m365.group.membership.add` | `m365.group.member.get` | the collection has an item | it is empty | read failed |
| `m365.intune.device.retire` | `m365.intune.device.get` | the read fails with `graph_not_found` — retire unenrols the device and Intune deletes the `managedDevice` record | the record is returned | any other failure |
| `m365.user.create` | `m365.user.get` on `userPrincipalName` | a resource with an `id` is returned | the read fails with `graph_not_found` | any other failure |
| `m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply` | `m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply.state` via `executeM365WriteActionByOrg` | returned `status` equals the requested `status` **and**, when the request set `externalAudience`, that matches too | either differs | the call refused or failed |

**Steps**
- [ ] Write `effectProbes.test.ts` first, mocking `./readActionService` and `./writeActionService`. Required cases:
  - one `satisfied` and one `unsatisfied` case per action id (16 assertions), driven from a table so adding an action id without a probe is a compile error (`Record<M365WriteActionId, ProbeCase>`);
  - **the honest-criterion test**: `revoke_sessions` with `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime` one second BEFORE `effectRequestedAt` is `unsatisfied`, and with the field absent is `unsatisfied`, never `satisfied`; and the returned `detail` contains the phrase `signInSessionsValidFromDateTime` so an operator reading the timeline sees what was actually observed;
  - `intune.device.retire` maps `graph_not_found` to `satisfied` and `graph_throttled` to `unknown`;
  - every read refusal code (`connection_not_ready`, `read_rate_limited`, `executor_unavailable`, `tools_disabled`) yields `unknown`, never `satisfied` — a probe that cannot observe must never claim success (spec §6.6);
  - `probeM365Effect('m365.user.disable', …)` — an action with no probe in the table — throws, rather than returning a default (there are ten write ids and eight probes; `m365.user.disable` and `m365.user.reset_password` are handled too, so in fact the table is total: add rows for them — `disable` probes `m365.user.get` and is `satisfied` when `accountEnabled === false`; `reset_password` has **no observable end state**, so it returns `unknown` with detail `'a password reset has no observable end state; verification is the operator receiving the credential'`);
  - `detail` is never longer than 500 characters and never contains a `temporaryPassword` value;
  - `observedAt` is an ISO-8601 instant produced from the injectable clock.
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ControlPlane/effectProbes.test.ts`.
- [ ] Implement. Keep it under 300 lines, one small function per action id, dispatched through a `Record<M365WriteActionId, ProbeFn>` so `tsc` fails the moment Task 2's id list grows again:
  ```ts
  type ProbeFn = (args: M365WriteAction, ctx: M365EffectProbeContext, now: () => Date) => Promise<M365EffectProbeResult>;
  const PROBES: Record<M365WriteActionId, ProbeFn> = { /* … */ };

  export async function probeM365Effect(
    actionId: M365WriteActionId,
    args: M365WriteAction,
    ctx: M365EffectProbeContext,
    now: () => Date = () => new Date(),
  ): Promise<M365EffectProbeResult> {
    if (args.type !== actionId) {
      throw new Error(`probeM365Effect: action id ${actionId} does not match args.type ${args.type}`);
    }
    return PROBES[actionId](args, ctx, now);
  }
  ```
  Add a file header stating: probes are **read-only**; a probe never mutates; `unknown` is the only answer when observation fails; and that `m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply` is the one probe that consumes the *write* budget and writes an `action_executed` audit row, with Decision 1's reason.
- [ ] Run green; then `cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`
- [ ] Commit: `feat(api): probeM365Effect — typed read-side verification for every M365 identity write`

---

### Task 9 — Register the eight tools across every registry

**Files (in edit order)**
1. `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsM365.ts` — `m365ToolTiers` (:46-52) and eight new handlers
2. `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.ts` — `TOOL_TIERS` (:325-331) and `m365ToolDefinitions` (:930-970)
3. `apps/api/src/services/aiGuardrails.ts` — `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS` (:405-406) and `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` (:1197-1198)
4. `apps/api/src/services/m365ToolsHeadless.ts` — `M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS` (:24-27) and a per-tool argument builder
5. `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/secretBearingTools.ts` (:24-27)
6. `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/resultSecrets.ts` (:32)
7. `apps/api/src/services/actionIntents/effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts` (:91)
8. `apps/api/src/services/aiAgentSdk.ts` — `M365_VERB` (:328-331)
9. `apps/api/src/routes/approvals.ts` — `M365_MUTATION_TOOLS` (:1484)
10. `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/tierConfig.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/ai-risk/ApprovalHistoryFeed.tsx` (:32)
11. Comment-only: `apps/api/src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts` (:1183-1190), `apps/api/src/config/validate.ts` (:713), `apps/mobile/src/services/approvals.ts` (:36-37), `apps/api/src/services/aiTools.ts` (:432)

**Tool-name ↔ action-id map (the single source both the tests and the code use):**

| Tool | Action id | Secret-bearing |
|---|---|---|
| `m365_revoke_sessions` | `m365.user.revoke_sessions` | no |
| `m365_remove_license` | `m365.user.license.remove` | no |
| `m365_assign_license` | `m365.user.license.assign` | no |
| `m365_remove_from_group` | `m365.group.membership.remove` | no |
| `m365_add_to_group` | `m365.group.membership.add` | no |
| `m365_retire_intune_device` | `m365.intune.device.retire` | no |
| `m365_create_user` | `m365.user.create` | **yes** |
| `m365_set_auto_reply` | `m365.user.mailbox.auto_reply` | no |

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing tests first:
  - `m365ToolsHeadless.test.ts`: the existing parity test (`keys(M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS) === tier-3 m365ToolTiers`) already covers drift — add a case pinning the exact ten-entry map, and one per new tool asserting `executeM365ToolHeadless` builds the right typed action from captured arguments (e.g. `m365_remove_from_group` with `{ groupId, userIdentifier, reason }` reaches `executeM365WriteActionByOrg` with `{ type: 'm365.group.membership.remove', groupId, userIdentifier, reason }`), plus one case per tool asserting that **invalid captured arguments return a JSON error body and never call the service**.
  - `aiGuardrails.m365.test.ts`: each of the eight resolves `checkGuardrails(tool, {}).tier === 3` and `approvalScope === 'four_eyes'`, and `TOOL_PERMISSIONS[tool]` is `{ resource: 'm365', action: 'execute' }`.
  - `actionIntents/secretBearingTools.test.ts`: `isSecretBearingTool('m365_create_user') === true`, and `isSecretBearingTool('m365_revoke_sessions') === false`.
  - `aiToolsM365.test.ts`: a handler test per tool — a missing `reason` returns `missing_reason`; a service refusal is surfaced verbatim as an error string; `m365CreateUserHandler` returns a `SecretToolResult` whose `llmText` does **not** contain the temporary password and whose `secrets.temporaryPassword` does.
  - `aiAgentSdk.m365risk.test.ts`: `buildM365RiskSummary` returns a non-null string for each of the eight (i.e. `M365_VERB` has an entry).
  - `jobs/intentReleaseWorker.durable.contract.test.ts` and `actionIntents/effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts` will go red on their own once the tools exist — that is expected and is the point of step 7 below.
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ToolsHeadless.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrails.m365.test.ts src/services/aiToolsM365.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/secretBearingTools.test.ts`
- [ ] **(1)** In `aiToolsM365.ts`: add the eight to `m365ToolTiers` at tier 3 with a comment separating "Delegant-backed helpdesk writes" from "control-plane identity writes (Operator Recipe Library M1)". Add one handler per tool, all following this shape (they take `_sessionId` and ignore it — Decision 3):
  ```ts
  /** Control-plane identity writes (M1). Unlike the Delegant-backed helpdesk
   *  handlers above, these never resolve a session or a Delegant connection:
   *  the org comes from the caller's auth (or an explicit orgId) and the whole
   *  authz ladder lives in executeM365WriteActionForAuth. */
  async function runWrite(

  ): Promise<string> {
    const result = await executeM365WriteActionForAuth(auth, action, inputOrgId(input));
    return result.ok
      ? JSON.stringify(result.result)
      : errorString(result.code, result.message);

    const parsed = m365WriteActionSchema.safeParse({ type: 'm365.user.revoke_sessions', userIdentifier, reason });
    if (!parsed.success) return errorString('invalid_arguments', 'Invalid parameters for this Microsoft 365 action.');
    return runWrite(auth, input, parsed.data);
  }
  ```
  `m365CreateUserHandler` returns `SecretToolResult` instead, following `m365ResetPasswordHandler` (:245-288) exactly: the credential goes in `secrets.temporaryPassword` and **never** in `llmText`.
- [ ] **(2)** In `aiAgentSdkTools.ts`: add the eight to `TOOL_TIERS` at 3 beside the existing two; add eight `tool(...)` declarations inside `m365ToolDefinitions()` with `makeSessionAwareHandler`, each description ending in "Requires approval." and carrying the real zod shape, e.g.:
  ```ts
  tool(
    'm365_remove_from_group',
    'Remove a Microsoft 365 user from a group. Does not work on dynamic-membership or role-assignable groups, which Microsoft manages. Requires approval.',
    { groupId: z.string().uuid(), userIdentifier: z.string(), reason: z.string(), orgId: uuid.optional() },
    makeSessionAwareHandler('m365_remove_from_group', getAuth, getActiveSession, m365RemoveFromGroupHandler, onPreToolUse, onPostToolUse)
  ),
  ```
  `m365_set_auto_reply` takes `{ userIdentifier, status: z.enum(['disabled','alwaysEnabled','scheduled']), internalReplyMessage: z.string().optional(), externalReplyMessage: z.string().optional(), externalAudience: z.enum(['none','contactsOnly','all']).optional(), scheduledStartDateTime: z.string().optional(), scheduledEndDateTime: z.string().optional(), reason, orgId? }`; `m365_create_user` takes `{ userPrincipalName, displayName, mailNickname, usageLocation, reason, orgId? }`; `m365_retire_intune_device` takes `{ managedDeviceId: z.string().uuid(), reason, orgId? }` with a description saying explicitly **"Retires the device (removes company data and unenrols it). This is not a full wipe and Breeze cannot perform one."**
- [ ] **(3)** In `aiGuardrails.ts`: append the eight tool names to `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS` right after `'m365_disable_user', 'm365_reset_password',` with a comment *"Identity / account control — M365 control-plane identity catalog (Operator Recipe Library M1, spec §7.1): all Tier 3, all four-eyes"*; add eight `{ resource: 'm365', action: 'execute' }` entries to `TOOL_PERMISSIONS` beside the existing pair.
- [ ] **(4)** In `m365ToolsHeadless.ts`: extend `M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS` with the eight entries, and replace the hardcoded `{ type, userIdentifier, reason }` construction (:66-70) with a typed builder:
  ```ts
  /** Tool name -> the typed action body built from the intent's CAPTURED
   *  arguments. Every field is read explicitly; nothing is spread, so a stale
   *  or attacker-influenced extra key can never reach Graph (the schema is
   *  .strict(), which turns a spread into a parse failure instead). */
  function buildWriteAction(actionId: M365WriteActionId, input: Record<string, unknown>): unknown {
    switch (actionId) {
      case 'm365.user.disable':
      case 'm365.user.reset_password':
      case 'm365.user.revoke_sessions':
        return { type: actionId, userIdentifier: input.userIdentifier, reason: input.reason };
      case 'm365.user.license.remove':
        return { type: actionId, userIdentifier: input.userIdentifier, skuIds: input.skuIds, reason: input.reason };
      case 'm365.user.license.assign':
        return {
          type: actionId, userIdentifier: input.userIdentifier, skuIds: input.skuIds,
          ...(input.disabledPlanIds === undefined ? {} : { disabledPlanIds: input.disabledPlanIds }),
          reason: input.reason,
        };
      case 'm365.group.membership.remove':
      case 'm365.group.membership.add':
        return { type: actionId, groupId: input.groupId, userIdentifier: input.userIdentifier, reason: input.reason };
      case 'm365.intune.device.retire':
        return { type: actionId, managedDeviceId: input.managedDeviceId, reason: input.reason };
      case 'm365.user.create':
        return {
          type: actionId, userPrincipalName: input.userPrincipalName, displayName: input.displayName,
          mailNickname: input.mailNickname, usageLocation: input.usageLocation, reason: input.reason,
        };
      case 'm365.user.mailbox.auto_reply':
        return {
          type: actionId, userIdentifier: input.userIdentifier, status: input.status,
          ...(input.internalReplyMessage === undefined ? {} : { internalReplyMessage: input.internalReplyMessage }),
          ...(input.externalReplyMessage === undefined ? {} : { externalReplyMessage: input.externalReplyMessage }),
          ...(input.externalAudience === undefined ? {} : { externalAudience: input.externalAudience }),
          ...(input.scheduledStartDateTime === undefined ? {} : { scheduledStartDateTime: input.scheduledStartDateTime }),
          ...(input.scheduledEndDateTime === undefined ? {} : { scheduledEndDateTime: input.scheduledEndDateTime }),
          reason: input.reason,
        };
      default: {
        const exhaustive: never = actionId;
        throw new Error(`buildWriteAction: unhandled ${String(exhaustive)}`);
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Add `'consent_upgrade_required'` to `CONNECTION_UNAVAILABLE_CODES` (:35-40) — nothing was dispatched to Graph, so it must fail closed as connection-unavailable rather than burn the intent as a terminal tool error, exactly like `connection_not_ready`. Add a test asserting this.
- [ ] **(5)** `SECRET_BEARING_TOOLS` gains `'m365_create_user'`.
- [ ] **(6)** In `resultSecrets.ts`, replace `const SECRET_BEARING_ACTION = 'm365.user.reset_password';` with
  ```ts
  const SECRET_BEARING_ACTIONS: ReadonlySet<string> = new Set([
    'm365.user.reset_password',
    // M1: POST /users carries a passwordProfile, so a created user's temporary
    // credential is sealed on exactly the same path as a reset.
    'm365.user.create',
  ]);
  ```
  and change the guard at :38 to `if (typeof result.action !== 'string' || !SECRET_BEARING_ACTIONS.has(result.action)) return result;`. Add a `resultSecrets.test.ts` case sealing an `m365.user.create` result.
- [ ] **(7)** In `effectDigestCoverage.contract.test.ts:91`, extend the `sharedReason([...])` list to all ten tool names and widen the reason text to *"the target is a Microsoft Graph user, group or Intune device object"*.
- [ ] **(8)** `M365_VERB` gains: `m365_revoke_sessions: 'Revoke all M365 sessions for'`, `m365_remove_license: 'Remove M365 licences from'`, `m365_assign_license: 'Assign M365 licences to'`, `m365_remove_from_group: 'Remove from M365 group'`, `m365_add_to_group: 'Add to M365 group'`, `m365_retire_intune_device: 'Retire Intune device for'`, `m365_create_user: 'Create M365 user'`, `m365_set_auto_reply: 'Set M365 auto-reply for'`. Update the doc comment above it (it says "the two M365 mutation tools").
- [ ] **(9)** `M365_MUTATION_TOOLS` becomes the ten-name set; update its comment likewise.
- [ ] **(10)** `tierConfig.ts`: add eight `ToolEntry` rows to the Tier 3 `tools` list under category `'Integrations'`, `name` exactly the bare tool name (the parity test parses it and runs `checkGuardrails`). `ApprovalHistoryFeed.tsx:32`: add the eight names to the M365 tool list there.
- [ ] **(11)** Refresh the four comments listed above so none of them still claims there are exactly two M365 mutation tools.
- [ ] Run green, in this order:
  ```
  cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ToolsHeadless.test.ts src/services/aiToolsM365.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrails.m365.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/secretBearingTools.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/resultSecrets.test.ts

  cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/ai-risk/
  cd apps/mobile && npx vitest run src/screens/approvals/
  ```
  `agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts` must stay green **without an edit to `agentToolCatalog.ts`** — if it goes red, the tools were registered into the shared `aiTools` map by mistake (Decision 2); fix the registration, not the test.

### Task 10 — Consent migration proof: v1 keeps working, v2-only refuses with its own code

**Files**
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/m365ConsentUpgradeLadder.integration.test.ts` (new)

**Interfaces** — *Consumes:* `executeM365WriteActionByOrg`, `connectionNeedsConsentReconciliation`, `m365RoleReadiness`, the integration test helpers already used by `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/` (`withSystemDbAccessContext` seeding + `withDbAccessContext` execution). *Produces:* nothing.

**Steps**
- [ ] Write the failing integration test first. It must run against real Postgres (`vitest.integration.config.ts`) and must be placed in `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/` — a file anywhere else runs zero tests. Cases:
  1. Seed org A with an `m365_connections` row: `profile = 'customer-graph-actions'`, `status = 'active'`, `permission_manifest_version = 1`, `grants_verified_at = now()`, `observed_grants` = the two v1 grants. Assert `connectionNeedsConsentReconciliation('customer-graph-actions', 1) === true`.
  2. Under org A's RLS context, `executeM365WriteActionByOrg(orgA, { type: 'm365.user.disable', … })` reaches the executor client (stubbed) — **v1 keeps working**.
  3. Same for `m365.user.reset_password`.
  4. `executeM365WriteActionByOrg(orgA, { type: 'm365.group.membership.remove', … })` returns `{ ok: false, code: 'consent_upgrade_required' }` and **never** `'connection_not_ready'`. Assert the code explicitly with `expect(result.code).toBe('consent_upgrade_required')` — a `not.toBe('connection_not_ready')` alone would pass on any other refusal.
  5. Seed org B with `permission_manifest_version = 2`, `grants_verified_at = now()`, `observed_grants` = all six v2 grants. All ten actions reach the executor.
  6. Seed org C with `grants_verified_at = null`. Every action reaches the executor (Decision 5 — no authoritative observation is not a refusal).
  7. `m365RoleReadiness` on org A's row reports `{ 'User.ReadWrite.All': true, 'GroupMember.ReadWrite.All': false, … }`.
  8. Cross-tenant: under org B's context, a read of org A's connection returns zero rows (RLS still holds through the new code path).
- [ ] Run red: `pnpm test-stack up` at the repo root, then `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/m365ConsentUpgradeLadder.integration.test.ts`.
- [ ] Fix whatever the red exposes in Task 5's ladder (no new production code should be needed if Task 5 is correct — if it is, that is the regression proof).
- [ ] Run green. Leave the stack up for Task 14; it is torn down there.
- [ ] Commit: `test(api): prove v1 M365 connections keep working and v2-only actions refuse with consent_upgrade_required`

### Task 11 — Web: the M365 actions card explains what v2 adds

**Files**
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/M365CustomerGraphActionsCard.tsx` (661 lines)
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/M365CustomerGraphActionsCard.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/locales/{en,de-DE,es-419,fr-CA,fr-FR,it-IT,pt-BR,tr-TR}/integrations.json`

**Interfaces** — *Consumes:* the existing `Envelope` (`connection.manifestVersion` vs `connection.currentManifestVersion` already distinguish v1 from v2; `profile.requiredGrants` already carries the v2 role list). *Produces:* no new API surface.

**Steps**
- [ ] Failing tests in `M365CustomerGraphActionsCard.test.tsx`:
  - when `connection.manifestVersion < connection.currentManifestVersion`, the card renders a `data-testid="m365-actions-upgrade-notice"` block, and the primary button reads the "Re-consent" label;
  - that block lists one plain-language purpose line per **new** role (the roles in `profile.requiredGrants` whose `value` is not one of the two v1 values), each with `data-testid="m365-actions-v2-purpose"`;
  - when `manifestVersion === currentManifestVersion` the notice is absent;
  - the purpose list renders a real translated sentence, not the raw role value (assert the rendered text does **not** equal `'GroupMember.ReadWrite.All'` and does contain the English purpose sentence);
  - a role in `requiredGrants` with no purpose key falls back to `m365CustomerGraphActions.v2.purpose.unknown` and still renders (no blank row).
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/integrations/M365CustomerGraphActionsCard.test.tsx`
- [ ] Implement. Add above the component:
  ```ts
  const V1_ROLE_VALUES = new Set(['User.ReadWrite.All', 'User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All']);
  /** Role value -> i18n key suffix. Role values contain dots, which i18next
   *  reads as key nesting, so they can never be used as keys directly. */
  const ROLE_PURPOSE_KEY: Record<string, string> = {
    'User.ReadWrite.All': 'userReadWrite',
    'User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All': 'userPasswordProfile',
    'GroupMember.ReadWrite.All': 'groupMember',
    'DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All': 'intunePrivileged',
    'MailboxSettings.ReadWrite': 'mailboxSettings',
    'Organization.Read.All': 'organizationRead',
  };
  ```
  and render the notice between the `errorCopy` paragraph (:588-590) and the connection `<dl>` (:592), gated on `connection && connection.manifestVersion < connection.currentManifestVersion`.
- [ ] Add these keys under `m365CustomerGraphActions` in **`en/integrations.json`**, then real translations in the other seven:

### Task 12 — Partner-level list of connections still on v1 (API)

**Files**
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/connectionService.ts` (add `listStaleManifestConnections` beside `listConnections` at :410)
- `apps/api/src/services/m365ControlPlane/writeActionConnectionService.ts` (re-export as `listStaleManifestCustomerGraphActionsConnections`)
- `apps/api/src/routes/m365CustomerGraphActions.ts`
- `apps/api/src/routes/m365CustomerGraphActions.test.ts`

**Interfaces**
- *Produces:*
  ```ts
  export interface StaleManifestConnection {
    id: string; orgId: string; orgName: string; displayName: string | null;
    tenantId: string | null; manifestVersion: number; currentManifestVersion: number;
    status: M365ConnectionStatus; lastVerifiedAt: string | null;
  }
  ```
  and route `GET /m365/customer-graph-actions/connections/stale-manifest` returning `{ currentManifestVersion: number; connections: StaleManifestConnection[] }`.

**Steps**
- [ ] Failing route tests in `m365CustomerGraphActions.test.ts`:
  - 401 unauthenticated; 403 without `organizations:read`;
  - a **partner-scoped** token gets 200 and only connections whose `permission_manifest_version < currentManifestVersion`;
  - an **organization-scoped** token gets 403 with a message saying the view is partner-scoped (there is nothing useful to show: an org token already sees its own card);
  - the route takes **no query parameters** — an unexpected one is a 400 (matching `parseOrganizationQuery`'s strictness at :156-167);
  - the response never carries `observed_grants`, `vault_ref`, `credential_version` or `client_id` (assert on the exact key set of a row).
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/m365CustomerGraphActions.test.ts`
- [ ] Implement `listStaleManifestConnections` in `connectionService.ts`. It runs under the caller's own RLS context (the route path's `withDbAccessContext` is opened by `authMiddleware`) — **never** a system context; a partner-scoped token passes `breeze_has_org_access` for every org under its partner, which is exactly the visibility this view wants, and RLS remains the boundary:
  ```ts
  async function listStaleManifestConnections(): Promise<StaleManifestConnection[]> {
    const rows = await db
      .select({
        id: m365Connections.id, orgId: m365Connections.orgId, orgName: organizations.name,
        displayName: m365Connections.displayName, tenantId: m365Connections.tenantId,
        manifestVersion: m365Connections.permissionManifestVersion,
        status: m365Connections.status, lastVerifiedAt: m365Connections.lastVerifiedAt,
      })
      .from(m365Connections)
      .innerJoin(organizations, eq(organizations.id, m365Connections.orgId))
      .where(and(
        eq(m365Connections.profile, profile),
        lt(m365Connections.permissionManifestVersion, deps.manifest.version),
      ))
      .orderBy(organizations.name)
      .limit(500);
    return rows.map((row) => ({ ...row, orgId: row.orgId as string, currentManifestVersion: deps.manifest.version, lastVerifiedAt: iso(row.lastVerifiedAt) }));
  }
  ```
  Add it to the returned service object and to the `ConnectionService` interface.
- [ ] Add the route in `m365CustomerGraphActions.ts`, above `GET /connections` so `:id`-style paths cannot shadow it:
  ```ts
  m365CustomerGraphActionsRoutes.get('/connections/stale-manifest', requireOrgsRead, async (c) => {
    if ([...new URL(c.req.url).searchParams.keys()].length > 0) {
      return c.json({ error: 'Invalid request' }, 400);
    }
    const auth = c.get('auth') as AuthContext;
    if (auth.scope !== 'partner') {
      return c.json({ error: 'This view is available to partner-scoped sessions.' }, 403);
    }
    const connections = await listStaleManifestCustomerGraphActionsConnections();
    return c.json({ currentManifestVersion: profileManifest.version, connections });
  });
  ```

### Task 13 — Web: partner re-consent table, and MOUNT it

**Files**
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/M365ActionsStaleManifestTable.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/M365ActionsStaleManifestTable.test.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/IntegrationsPage.tsx` (the MOUNT — a previous wave shipped thirteen green components that were never wired into a page; this task is not done until the page test passes)
- `apps/web/src/components/integrations/IntegrationsPage.test.tsx`
- the eight `integrations.json` locale files

**Steps**
- [ ] Failing tests.

  `M365ActionsStaleManifestTable.test.tsx`:
  - renders nothing at all (not an empty card) when the fetch returns `connections: []`;
  - renders one row per connection with `data-testid="m365-stale-connection-row"`, showing org name, tenant display name and `Manifest version {{version}}`;
  - renders the loading skeleton, then the table;
  - on a 403 (organization-scoped session) renders nothing and logs no error toast — the view simply does not apply;
  - on a 500 renders an error region with `role="alert"`;
  - selecting a row writes `window.location.hash` and does not use a query param.

  `IntegrationsPage.test.tsx` (the mount proof):
  - with a partner-scoped session the page renders `data-testid="m365-stale-manifest-table"`;
  - with an organization-scoped session it does not.
- [ ] Run red: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/integrations/`
- [ ] Implement the component using the existing card's conventions: `fetchWithAuth`, a strict `parse*` validator for the response (copy the `hasExactKeys` / `parseGrants` pattern rather than trusting the body), `useTranslation("integrations")`, `formatDateTime`, `data-testid` on every queried node. It is read-only, so no `runAction` call is needed — say so in a comment so a reviewer does not flag the absence.
- [ ] Mount it in `IntegrationsPage.tsx` immediately after `<M365CustomerGraphActionsCard />`, gated on `getJwtClaims().scope === 'partner'`.
- [ ] Add locale keys `m365CustomerGraphActions.staleManifest.{title,description,empty,columnOrganization,columnTenant,columnVersion,columnLastVerified,loadFailed}` in all eight locales, with real translations (English: title "Organizations needing Microsoft 365 re-consent"; description "These customers are still on an earlier permission set. Open the organization to start re-consent."; loadFailed "The re-consent list could not be loaded.").
- [ ] Run green: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/integrations/ && npx vitest run src/locales/`
- [ ] Commit: `feat(web): partner view of Microsoft 365 connections still on permission profile v1`

### Task 14 — Full verification, lab gate, and PR

**Steps**
- [ ] Unit + contract suites, all of which must be green:
  ```
  cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/m365/
  cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx vitest run src/
  cd apps/m365-graph-read-executor && npx vitest run src/
  cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/m365ControlPlane/ src/services/m365ToolsHeadless.test.ts src/services/aiToolsM365.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrails.m365.test.ts src/services/aiGuardrailsTierConfig.parity.test.ts src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts src/services/actionIntents/ src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.test.ts src/jobs/intentReleaseWorker.durable.contract.test.ts src/routes/m365CustomerGraphActions.test.ts src/routes/approvals.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdk.m365risk.test.ts src/services/aiAgentSdkTools.sessionAware.test.ts src/services/aiToolNames.test.ts src/config/validate.test.ts
  cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/integrations/ src/components/ai-risk/ src/locales/
  cd apps/mobile && npx vitest run src/screens/approvals/
  ```
- [ ] Typecheck every package touched:
  ```
  cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
  cd apps/m365-graph-actions-executor && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
  cd apps/m365-graph-read-executor && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
  cd apps/api && NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
  cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
  ```
- [ ] Integration suites against the live stack (`pnpm test-stack up` at the repo root if it is down):
  ```
  cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
    src/__tests__/integration/m365ConsentUpgradeLadder.integration.test.ts \
    src/__tests__/integration/intentReleaseWorkerM365Headless.integration.test.ts \
    src/__tests__/integration/secretBearingToolSeal.integration.test.ts \
    src/__tests__/integration/agentIntentLifecycle.integration.test.ts
  ```
  **The tenancy contract suites (`rls-coverage`, `tenantCascade`, `tenant-export-policy`, `orgLifecycleFoundations`) are NOT in this list on purpose: this wave adds no table and no column** (Global Constraints). Run `git diff --stat origin/main -- apps/api/migrations apps/api/src/db/schema` and confirm it is empty. **If it is not empty, stop — something went wrong and the four suites plus the registration lists are now mandatory.**
- [ ] `pnpm lint` at the repo root.
- [ ] `pnpm test-stack down` at the repo root. Report anything left running.
- [ ] Record the **lab gate** in the PR body as an explicit open item (do not attempt it from this session): against a real Microsoft 365 developer tenant on profile v2 —
  1. every one of the ten actions executes and its probe returns `satisfied`;
  2. re-running each `idempotent` action is a no-op by observation (`noop: true` or an unchanged post-probe);
  3. `m365.group.membership.remove` against a dynamic-membership group and against a role-assignable group both return `unsupported_group_type` **with no membership call in the tenant's audit log**;
  4. `m365.user.license.assign` against a fully-consumed SKU returns `license_unavailable` with no `assignLicense` call;
  5. `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All` alone is sufficient to read `groupTypes` and `isAssignableToRole` (Decision 6 — if not, file the `Group.Read.All` v3 follow-up);
  6. `m365.user.create`'s temporary password is revealable exactly once and appears in no log.
- [ ] Open the PR with `Closes #<wave sub-issue>` in the body, the decision list above, the verified app-role GUIDs and their source URL, and the lab gate as an unchecked checklist. **STOP. Do not merge.**

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.** §7.1 (the eight actions, their Graph calls and classes) → Tasks 2, 3, and the `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDEMPOTENCY` map in Task 2. §7.1 app roles and least privilege → Task 4. §7.1's "each action touches, in one PR, …" registry list → Task 9. §7.2 (v2 once) → Task 4; (v1 keeps working) → Tasks 5 and 10; (settings card explains v2) → Task 11; (per-role readiness from `observed_grants`) → `m365RoleReadiness` in Task 5; (partner-level v1 list) → Tasks 12 and 13. §6.6 (probe → write → probe, no dedup store, `noop` by observation, `non_idempotent` never auto-retried) → Tasks 3, 6, 7, 8. §4.1 (readiness inputs) → `m365RoleReadiness` + `connectionNeedsConsentReconciliation` (Tasks 4, 5). §10 row M1 (independent of E1–E4) → nothing in this plan imports from `services/aiOperator/`.

**Placeholder scan.** No `TBD`, no `TODO`, no "similar to", no "add validation". The four app-role GUIDs carry an explicit `VERIFY`-before-commit instruction with the source URL, which is a deliberate verification step, not a placeholder — Task 4 will not pass its own tests with a malformed GUID and the lab gate catches a wrong-but-well-formed one.

**Identifier consistency.** `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDS` / `M365_PROBE_ACTION_IDS` / `M365ExecutorActionId` / `M365_WRITE_ACTION_IDEMPOTENCY` / `M365_WRITE_ACTION_REQUIRED_ROLES` (Task 2) are consumed by name in Tasks 3, 4, 5, 8, 9. `m365RoleReadiness` (Task 5) is consumed in Tasks 5, 10, and its shape is what Task 11's card renders from `profile.requiredGrants`. `executeM365ReadActionByOrg` (Task 7) is consumed only by Task 8. `probeM365Effect` (Task 8) has no consumer inside this wave — it is the interface the R1 recipe wave calls, which is why Task 8's tests are the only proof it works and are written to be exhaustive over the id list. `executeM365WriteActionForAuth` (Task 5) is consumed only by Task 9's handlers. The tool-name ↔ action-id table in Task 9 is the single source for `M365_HEADLESS_ACTIONS`, `M365_VERB`, `M365_MUTATION_TOOLS`, `TIER3_FOUR_EYES_TOOLS`, `TOOL_PERMISSIONS`, `tierConfig.ts` and `ApprovalHistoryFeed.tsx`.
