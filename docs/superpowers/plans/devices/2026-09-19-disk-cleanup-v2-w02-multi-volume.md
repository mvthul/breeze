# Disk Cleanup v2 W02: Multi-Volume — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give filesystem analysis a scan-path axis, so a `D:\` or `/data` scan no longer resets the `C:\` baseline, pollutes its `hotDirectories`, or becomes the "latest" snapshot a `C:\` cleanup preview deletes from — and surface every fixed local volume as a first-class thing you can pick, scan and clean.

**Architecture:** Two idempotent migrations add `scan_path` to `device_filesystem_snapshots` / `device_filesystem_scan_state` / `device_filesystem_cleanup_runs`, re-key the scan-state primary key on `(device_id, scan_path)`, add `kind` + `command_id` to cleanup runs, and add the `running` cleanup-run status. One shared, browser-safe `normalizeScanPath(osType, path)` in `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.ts` is the single definition of the key, used by the API and the web. A new `services/filesystemVolumes.ts` turns `device_disks` rows into scannable `Volume`s (`isScannableVolume` + `NON_SCANNABLE_FS_TYPES`), which `GET /devices/:id/filesystem/volumes` serves and which the scan route uses for root detection and for the disk-percent delta. The schema and the code ship as ONE API release: `upsertFilesystemScanState`'s `ON CONFLICT` target moves with the primary key, and the two cannot be separated without `42P10`.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript (Hono API, Drizzle ORM, Postgres 16), hand-written SQL migrations applied by `autoMigrate`, Vitest (unit + integration configs), React 19 + jsdom (`apps/web`), i18next across 8 locales. No Go, no agent release in this wave.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-19-disk-cleanup-v2-design.md` — §2 defects 6 and 8, §3 row W02, §4 in full, §5.1 in full, §5.2 (the `path`/`scanPath` pinning only), §8 (the `VolumePicker` + `useFilesystemVolumes` + the mount into the existing tab only), §9 (the `path` parameter on `analyze_disk_usage` and `disk_cleanup` only), §11 (the API/web/docs rows that apply to this wave).

**Branch:** `feature/<parent#>-disk-cleanup-v2/wave-<subissue#>`

## Plan amendments

Every spec claim this wave depends on was re-verified against the working tree on 2026-09-19 (`main` at `e4525ea7e8`, branch `spec/disk-cleanup-v2`). Where the spec is wrong or under-specified, the verified fact and the plan's response are recorded here. Nothing below is a silent deviation.

1. **`normalizeScanPath` cannot use `node:path`, so the POSIX rules are implemented over plain strings.** Spec §4 says "POSIX — `path.posix.normalize`". But `packages/shared/src/utils/index.ts` is re-exported from the package root barrel (`packages/shared/src/index.ts:4`), which `apps/web` bundles, and `packages/shared/src/browserSafeBarrel.test.ts:22` fails any module transitively reachable from that barrel which imports a Node builtin — `path` is in its list, and the assertion at `:71` is `expect(offenders).toEqual([])`. Task 1 therefore ships a self-contained segment resolver (`.` / `..` / repeated separators) with no imports at all, and its test pins the cases `path.posix.normalize` would produce.

2. **The OS column is `devices.os_type`, not `devices.os`.** Spec §4 writes "`<os root from devices.os>`". Verified: `apps/api/src/db/schema/devices.ts:63` is `osType: osTypeEnum('os_type')`, and the enum at `:7` is `pgEnum('os_type', ['windows', 'macos', 'linux'])`. (`device.os` in `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceDetails.tsx:833` is the web DTO's field name, which is unrelated to the column.) The migration's backfill `CASE` keys on `d.os_type`.

3. **The snapshot backfill must normalise `raw_payload->>'path'`, not copy it — and rows carrying a dot segment are stored verbatim on purpose.** Spec §4 shows a bare `COALESCE(NULLIF(raw_payload->>'path',''), <os root>)`. Verified that today's scans accept any path (`scanFilesystemBodySchema`, `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts:32-42`) and that defect 6 itself names `c:\` (lower case) as a real shape. A verbatim copy would leave every historical row keyed on a form no normalised read ever matches, i.e. the whole existing snapshot history would vanish from the tab on deploy. The migration therefore mirrors §4's normalisation rules in SQL, in ONE transient helper function (`breeze_w02_normalize_scan_path`, created and dropped inside the migration) that both backfills call, so the two provably agree. The one rule it does NOT mirror is `.`/`..` resolution, which is impractical set-based SQL; a row whose recorded path contains a dot segment is stored **verbatim** and counted in a `RAISE WARNING`. Such a row is inert (it matches no normalised read) and the next scan supersedes it. Deliberately not re-keyed to the OS root, which would fold another volume's candidates into the root preview.

4. **The scan-state key swap is guarded on the actual column list — but in W02 it is a UNIQUE INDEX, not a primary key (see amendment 15).** Spec §4's `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS …; ADD PRIMARY KEY (…)` rebuilds the key index on every re-apply, and `db:check-drift` re-applies the whole set. Verified the baseline names the old single-column key `device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey` (`apps/api/migrations/0001-baseline.sql:6920`) and that nothing references it — `git grep "REFERENCES.*device_filesystem" -- apps/api/migrations` is empty, and the only code references are `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts:131` and `:178`. W02 drops that constraint (which does NOT drop `device_id`'s `NOT NULL`) and creates `device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx` on `(device_id, scan_path)`, guarded on `pg_index` rather than on a name alone. W03 promotes it with `ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX …`, which keeps the baseline name.

5. **`db:check-drift` does not compare the Drizzle mirror to the database.** Spec §4 says "`db:check-drift` must be clean", which is necessary but weaker than it reads: `apps/api/scripts/check-drift.ts:17-34` states in its own header that schema-vs-live-DB comparison is "intentionally NOT checked here" and that the script only applies the migration set to a fresh database and verifies the `breeze_migrations` ledger. The Drizzle mirror's correctness — the unique index, the four new columns, the index swap — is therefore proved by the replay integration suite in Task 5, which reads `pg_index` / `pg_indexes` / `information_schema.columns` and round-trips inserts through the Drizzle table objects.

6. **The agent result handler has no OS in scope, so it reads one.** Spec §5.1 says the handler "keys on `command.payload.path` (normalised)", but normalisation is OS-dependent and `handleFilesystemAnalysisCommandResult(command, resultData, orgId)` (`apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts:1593`) is called with `agent.orgId` only (`apps/api/src/routes/agents/commands.ts:525`); `AgentAuthContext` (`apps/api/src/middleware/agentAuth.ts:21-44`) carries `deviceId`, `agentId`, `orgId`, `siteId`, `partnerId`, `role` — no OS. Task 11 adds one indexed `devices.os_type` lookup ahead of the existing `Promise.all`, and returns without writing a snapshot (with a warning) when the device row is absent, rather than guessing POSIX and mis-keying a Windows device.

7. **`saveFilesystemSnapshot`'s argument list gains `scanPath` at index 3, and two live assertions destructure it positionally.** `apps/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts:1333-1336` and `:1376-1379` read `const [sfDeviceId, , sfTrigger, sfPayload] = vi.mocked(saveFilesystemSnapshot).mock.calls[0]!`. The new signature is `(deviceId, orgId, trigger, scanPath, payload)` — all scalars, then the blob. Both destructures are updated in the same task as the signature change (Task 6), so no task leaves the repo red.

8. **`disk_cleanup`'s Zod schema has no `path`; `analyze_disk_usage`'s already does.** Spec §9 says both "gain `path`". Verified `apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemas.ts:987` already carries `path: safePath.optional()` under `analyze_disk_usage`, while `disk_cleanup` (`:998-1007`) does not. Task 12 adds the schema field to `disk_cleanup` only; both handlers change.

9. **`GET /filesystem` keeps `path` and ADDS `scanPath`.** `readSnapshotPath` (`apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts:64-70`) reads `raw_payload.path` and is what the tab renders as "Scan Path" (`deviceFilesystemTab.scanPath`). The plan keeps `path` (the raw string the agent actually walked) and adds `scanPath` (the normalised key). Replacing `path` would silently change an existing panel in a wave whose scope explicitly excludes the panels.

10. **`cleanup-execute` gets no `path` field in W02, so it derives one.** §5.2's execute changes (required `cleanupRunId`, `rejectedPaths`, the budget) belong to W01/W03; this wave's §5.2 scope is the preview pinning plus `scanPath` in responses. The pinned lane therefore reads `device_filesystem_cleanup_runs.scan_path` (falling back to `plan.scanPath`, then the OS root); the unpinned fallback lane resolves to the OS root. That IS a behaviour change on the fallback lane — it used to take the newest snapshot of ANY path — and it is precisely defect 6's fix. W03 makes `cleanupRunId` required and deletes the lane.

11. **Cascade registration: verified unchanged, with the greps.** All three tables are already in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` (`apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts:443-445`), `CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES` (`apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts:282-283`) and `CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES` (`apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts:588`). None carries a `ticket_id`, so `TICKET_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES` / `CUSTOM_ORG_REWRITE_TABLES` (`apps/api/src/services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts`) are untouched — `git grep device_filesystem` in that file returns nothing. None is append-only, so `AUDIT_ADMIN_REQUIRED_TABLES` is untouched. RLS allowlists are untouched: all three are tenancy shape 1 (direct `org_id`), their policies are `breeze_has_org_access(org_id)` (`apps/api/migrations/2026-04-11-bucket-c-phase-3-device-state-rls.sql:81-89` for scan state, `:92-110` for snapshots) and are key-independent, and `git grep device_filesystem -- apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts` returns nothing. **The export policy is the one registry that fires**, because it fires on new COLUMNS — Task 4 adds all six (`scan_path` ×3, `kind`, `command_id`, `scan_generation`).

12. **Locale values must not be bare filesystem paths.** `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts:442` fails any locale leaf that "looks like a route or filesystem path". The volume chip therefore interpolates the mount point (`{{mountPoint}}`) rather than storing `C:\` in a catalog, and every new key is translated for real in all eight locales (`en`, `pt-BR`, `es-419`, `fr-FR`, `fr-CA`, `de-DE`, `it-IT`, `tr-TR` — the exact set asserted at `:422`).

13. **Migration filenames re-verified against `origin/main` at 12:10 MDT on 2026-09-19 and BUMPED.** `git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main -- apps/api/migrations | grep '\.sql$' | sort | tail` now ends with two `2026-10-20-150000-*` files (`bare-metal-recoveries-dr-link`, `partner-api-contract-scopes`) that landed this morning, so the spec's original `150000`/`150100` would have sorted BEFORE `…-partner-api-contract-scopes.sql` and failed `check-migration-naming.sh` rule 3. Both files are therefore `2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql` and `2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql` (W03's contraction migration was originally dated `2026·10·21` at time `11:02:00`, later renamed to `2026-10-22-160000` when main's topology work landed ahead of it during PR #6366's merge-forward — see that PR). Task 2 Step 1 re-runs `scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main` at commit time; if `main` has moved past `160100`, bump the time component on all three files (this wave's two and W03's) and record it here.
14. **W02 does NOT remove `DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx` from `runActionAllowlist.ts`.** Spec §8 says the tab "leaves `runActionAllowlist.ts`" — that is a W03 item, when the tab's mutations are rewritten. Verified `apps/web/src/lib/runActionAllowlist.ts:17` lists the file today. W02 adds only GET traffic (the volumes hook) and re-points existing request bodies; it introduces no new mutation, so the entry stays and `no-silent-mutations.test.ts` is unaffected.

> Amendments 15–18 come from the Codex `gpt-6-astra` xhigh quorum review recorded in spec §13 (findings #7, #8 and #18, plus one defect the review's #18 narrative exposed). All three §13 findings are adopted verbatim; they tighten rollout contracts the spec's §4 stated too loosely, and they supersede §4 where the two disagree.

15. **Expand/contract: `scan_path` is NULLABLE in W02; `SET NOT NULL` is W03 (spec §13 #7).** The original plan added the column `NOT NULL` in the same migration as the backfill. On a multi-replica self-host — and on any deployment where the migration lands before the last old replica drains — an old replica's `INSERT INTO device_filesystem_snapshots` supplies no `scan_path` and fails `23502`, so a scan completing mid-deploy loses its snapshot outright. W02 therefore adds `scan_path` nullable on `device_filesystem_snapshots` and `device_filesystem_scan_state`, backfills, and stops. **Hand-off: W03 ships `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`** — `SET NOT NULL` on both columns plus the primary-key promotion in amendment 16 — after W02 is deployed everywhere. The Drizzle mirror declares both columns nullable in W02, so `snapshot.scanPath` is `string | null` and every reader falls back to the scan path it asked for (`snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath`); that fallback is load-bearing exactly for rows an old replica wrote during the window.

16. **The scan-state composite key is a UNIQUE INDEX in W02, promoted to the primary key in W03 (spec §13 #7).** A primary key requires `NOT NULL`, which amendment 15 defers — but the old single-column `device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey` cannot simply stay, because it permits only ONE row per device and multi-volume scan state is the whole point of the wave. Resolution: W02 drops the single-column constraint (verified in Postgres this does NOT drop `device_id`'s `NOT NULL`, which the baseline set independently) and creates `device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx` — a nullable-tolerant unique index on `(device_id, scan_path)`. `onConflictDoUpdate({ target: [deviceId, scanPath] })` emits `ON CONFLICT (device_id, scan_path)`, which Postgres infers against a plain unique index exactly as it does against a constraint, so the writer contract works unchanged. W03's migration runs `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`, which promotes the existing index in place and restores the baseline constraint name. **The rolling-deploy caveat is now precise: old replicas' snapshot INSERTS keep working (the column is nullable); their scan-state UPSERTS fail with `42P10` from the moment the single-column key is dropped until they drain, and a re-run scan repairs that state.** The original plan's claim that "the snapshot insert itself still succeeds" was true only of the scan-state failure mode and false for the snapshot column — it is correct only under this expand/contract shape.

17. **The legacy scan-state backfill must not relabel another volume's checkpoint (spec §13 #8).** The original plan set every legacy row's `scan_path` to the device's OS root. A device whose last scan was `D:\` carries a `D:\` checkpoint, `D:\` aggregate and `D:\` hot directories; relabelling that row `C:\` makes the next `C:\` scan resume into `D:\` paths and inherit `D:\` hot directories — defect 6 reintroduced by the migration that fixes it. The backfill now runs in two passes. **Pass A (matched):** take the device's newest snapshot's already-normalised `scan_path` (the snapshot backfill runs first in the same file, so the two agree by construction) and adopt it when it equals the device's OS root or the normalised `mount_point` of one of its `device_disks` rows; the resume state is kept. **Pass B (everything else):** set the OS root but **clear** `checkpoint = '{}'`, `aggregate = '{}'` and `hot_directories = '[]'`, keeping `last_baseline_completed_at` and `last_disk_used_percent` (they are volume-agnostic enough to be worth keeping and a wrong `last_disk_used_percent` only costs one baseline). Cost of pass B is one re-scan. Both counts go to separate `RAISE WARNING`s.

18. **`scan_generation` closes the same-path concurrent-scan race, and the in-flight continuation check was device-wide (spec §13 #18).** Two scans of the same volume can be in flight at once (an auto-resume continuation plus a user-triggered rescan, or two operators), and the later result overwrites the earlier one's checkpoint with a stale frontier. W02 adds `device_filesystem_scan_state.scan_generation uuid` (nullable) = the `filesystem_analysis` command id that started the current run for that `(device, scan_path)`. Every producer writes it after queuing — the scan route, the threshold queue (`maybeQueueThresholdFilesystemAnalysis`) and the auto-resume continuation — through `setFilesystemScanGeneration`, a plain `UPDATE` that is a no-op when no state row exists yet. The result handler **claims** the generation with a single conditional `UPDATE … SET scan_generation = NULL WHERE … AND scan_generation = :commandId RETURNING`, which makes application both exclusive and idempotent: a superseded generation and a duplicate delivery of the same command both fail the claim and are logged and dropped. Separately, while verifying this, the continuation-suppression read at `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts:1695-1705` was found to match `deviceCommands.type = 'filesystem_analysis'` with `status IN ('pending','sent')` **for the whole device**, with no path predicate — so an in-flight `C:\` scan silently cancels a `D:\` baseline's auto-resume. Task 11 scopes that read to `payload->>'path' = scanPath`.

---

19. **Migration names bumped a second time at dispatch (2026-09-19 16:05 MDT).** `origin/main` gained `2026-10-20-160000-ai-tool-executions-created-at-idx.sql` after the plan was written; a same-prefix tie would sort only by slug, so this wave ships `2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql` and `2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql`, and W03's contraction file is `2026-10-22-160000-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`. All references in this document, the index, the spec and the W03 plan were updated in the W02 PR.

## Global Constraints

- **Schema and code ship in ONE PR.** `upsertFilesystemScanState` currently uses `onConflictDoUpdate({ target: deviceFilesystemScanState.deviceId })` (`apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts:177-180`); once the single-column key is dropped that target names no unique index and every upsert fails with `42P10`. Never split this wave into a schema PR and a code PR (spec §4, "Writer contract change").
- **Expand only; contract in W03.** Every column this wave adds is nullable or defaulted. No `SET NOT NULL`, no primary key, nothing an old replica can violate (amendments 15–16, spec §13 #7). **W03 owes `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`**: `SET NOT NULL` on `device_filesystem_snapshots.scan_path` and `device_filesystem_scan_state.scan_path`, then `ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`. That file is named in the W03 plan and in this PR's body; it is the only contract step, and it must not be attempted here.
- **Migration filenames must sort strictly after every committed migration.** `2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql` then `2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql`; re-check with `bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main` before pushing (CLAUDE.md, "Schema Migration Workflow").
- **The enum add is its own file with no other statements.** A label added by `ALTER TYPE` cannot be used in the transaction that added it, and `autoMigrate` wraps each file in one (spec §4; precedent `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-17-110400-report-type-endpoint-management-review.sql`).
- **Any migration that writes rows elects system scope first.** `PERFORM set_config('breeze.scope', 'system', true);` as the first statement inside every `DO` block that writes, per `apps/api/src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts`. Without it the backfill silently matches zero rows and `RAISE WARNING` prints a truthful-looking `0`. **Never add a file to that suite's `UNSCOPED_DML_BASELINE`.**
- **Migrations are idempotent and never edited once shipped.** `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS`, `pg_constraint` existence checks, backfills gated on `WHERE scan_path IS NULL`. No inner `BEGIN;`/`COMMIT;` — `autoMigrate` owns the transaction.
- **Cleanup statements report row counts.** Every backfill wraps in `DO $$ … GET DIAGNOSTICS n = ROW_COUNT; IF n > 0 THEN RAISE WARNING …; END IF; END $$;`.
- **Test files live alongside their source.** `apps/api/src/services/filesystemVolumes.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/VolumePicker.test.tsx`, `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.test.ts`. The migration replay suite is the exception: it needs a live database, so it goes under `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/`, which `vitest.integration.config.ts`'s shared glob already covers (no config edit needed — see the comments on `staleBackupReaper.integration.test.ts`).
- **Test commands.** API: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run <path>`. Web: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run <path>`. Shared: `cd packages/shared && npx vitest run <path>`. API integration: `cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts <path>`. **Never `pnpm --filter <pkg> test -- --run <path>`** — pnpm forwards the literal `--`, vitest swallows `--run` as a positional filter, and the whole suite runs in watch mode (CLAUDE.md, "Two traps"). Vitest path filters are plain substrings, so list sibling files explicitly and check the reported file count.
- **Typecheck commands (what CI's Type Check job runs, from the repo root).** `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json`; `pnpm --filter @breeze/shared typecheck`; `cd apps/web && pnpm exec astro check`.
- **Every web mutation goes through `runAction`.** This wave adds no mutation, so `apps/web/src/lib/runActionAllowlist.ts` is untouched (amendment 14).
- **New UI strings exist, translated, in all eight locales** under `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/devices.json`, with matching interpolation tokens and no bare paths as values (`localeParity.test.ts`).
- **`db:check-drift` must pass** (`DATABASE_URL=… pnpm db:check-drift`) — it proves the migration set applies to a fresh database in filename order, which is what catches an ordering or idempotency bug (amendment 5).
- **File-size guideline.** `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx` is already 958 lines and this wave adds to it. The full split into `filesystem/` is W03's job (spec §8); W02 puts its NEW code in `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/` (hook + picker) and adds only the composition wiring to the tab, so the tab grows by well under 100 lines and W03 inherits two files it does not have to write.
- **Rigor is HIGH for Tasks 2–6 and 11** (migration, primary-key swap, tenant-export registry, the agent write path) and medium elsewhere. Red first on every task. Run the integration contract suites before the PR, always — this wave touches a cascade-registered table's columns.
- **Branch `feature/<parent#>-disk-cleanup-v2/wave-<subissue#>`; PR body contains `Closes #<subissue#>`. Run `get_feature_status` before starting and `start_wave` when you branch.**
- **Commit after every task**, with the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

**Why this task order.** Tasks 1–5 land the contract (the key function, the schema, the registries, the proof) without changing a single reader. Task 6 moves the whole service onto the `(deviceId, scanPath)` axis and pins every existing caller to `osRootScanPath(device.osType)` — which is *exactly* today's behaviour, because today there is one scan-state row per device and one snapshot stream per device, and keying both on the OS root is the same row and the same stream. The repo compiles and every existing test passes after Task 6. Tasks 7–12 then replace that placeholder with the real per-volume path, one surface at a time. Tasks 13–14 do the UI, with the mount and its page-level test as a task of its own. Task 15 is docs; Task 16 is the verification gate.

### Task 1: `normalizeScanPath` — the single definition of the scan-path key

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.ts`
- Create: `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.test.ts` (Test)
- Modify: `packages/shared/src/utils/index.ts` (append one export line)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing. This module imports nothing at all, by design (amendment 1).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type ScanPathOsType = 'windows' | 'macos' | 'linux';
  export function osRootScanPath(osType: unknown): string;
  export function normalizeScanPath(osType: unknown, path: string): string;

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/utils/scanPath.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `Failed to load .../src/utils/scanPath.test.ts` … `Cannot find module './scanPath'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — create `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Scan-path normalisation for multi-volume filesystem analysis
 * (disk cleanup v2 spec §4).
 *
 * `device_filesystem_snapshots.scan_path` and the `(device_id, scan_path)`
 * primary key of `device_filesystem_scan_state` are keyed on the NORMALISED
 * form, so every producer and every reader has to agree byte for byte. `c:\`
 * and `C:\` are the same volume; keying them separately IS defect 6 — a
 * lower-cased drive never resumes its own checkpoint, and a `D:\` scan lands
 * on top of the `C:\` baseline.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IMPORTS NOTHING, on purpose. It is reachable from
 * `@breeze/shared`'s root barrel, which `apps/web` bundles, and
 * `browserSafeBarrel.test.ts` fails any module in that closure which imports a
 * Node builtin — `node:path` included. The rules below are the subset of
 * `path.win32.normalize` / `path.posix.normalize` that scan paths need,
 * implemented over plain strings.
 *
 * Rules (spec §4):
 *   Windows — separators become `\`, repeats collapse, the drive letter is
 *   upper-cased, and a trailing `\` survives ONLY on a volume root (`C:\`,
 *   `D:\`). A UNC path keeps exactly two leading separators so the volumes
 *   filter can recognise and refuse it.
 *   POSIX  — repeats collapse, `.`/`..` resolve, and a trailing `/` survives
 *   only on `/` itself.
 * Case below the drive letter is PRESERVED on both: `/Users` and `/users` are
 * different directories on a case-sensitive volume, and folding them would
 * silently merge two scans.

function resolveSegments(segments: readonly string[], absolute: boolean): string[] {

- [ ] **Step 4: Export it from the utils barrel** — append to `packages/shared/src/utils/index.ts`, after the `export * from './vulnerabilityManagement';` line that ends the file:

```ts
export * from './scanPath';
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run src/utils/scanPath.test.ts src/browserSafeBarrel.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  2 passed (2)`. The barrel guard must be green — it is what proves the no-import rule (amendment 1) actually held.

- [ ] **Step 6: Typecheck the shared package**

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/shared typecheck
```

Expected: no output, exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.ts packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.test.ts packages/shared/src/utils/index.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(shared): normalizeScanPath — one definition of the filesystem scan-path key

Spec §4. `c:\` and `C:\` are the same volume; keying them separately is defect
6. This is the function the API, the web tab and the migration backfill all
agree on. No imports at all: the module is reachable from the root barrel that
apps/web bundles, so node:path is not available (browserSafeBarrel.test.ts).

Nothing consumes it yet.

### Task 2: Migration 1 — the scan-path axis, the PK swap, and the normalising backfills

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `public.devices.os_type` (amendment 2), `public.device_filesystem_snapshots.raw_payload`, `public.device_disks.mount_point`.
- Produces:
  - `device_filesystem_snapshots.scan_path text` — **NULLABLE** (amendment 15); index `idx_device_filesystem_snapshots_device_path_captured`, old `idx_device_filesystem_snapshots_device_captured` dropped.
  - `device_filesystem_scan_state.scan_path text` — **NULLABLE**; `.scan_generation uuid` NULL (amendment 18); single-column `device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey` dropped; unique index `device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx (device_id, scan_path)` (amendment 16).
  - `device_filesystem_cleanup_runs.scan_path text NULL`, `.kind text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'files'` with `device_filesystem_cleanup_runs_kind_chk`, `.command_id uuid NULL`.
- **Hands off to W03:** `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql` — `ALTER COLUMN scan_path SET NOT NULL` on both tables, then `ALTER TABLE public.device_filesystem_scan_state ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`. **Not in this wave**; it runs only after W02 is deployed everywhere.

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-verify the filename sorts last (amendment 13)**

```bash
git fetch origin main --quiet
git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main -- apps/api/migrations | grep -E '\.sql$' | sed 's|.*/||' | sort | tail -3
```

Expected: the last line is `2026-10-20-150000-partner-api-contract-scopes.sql` (or something that still sorts before `2026-10-20-160000-`). If anything sorts at or after `2026-10-20-160000-`, pick later time components for BOTH files in this wave, use them everywhere below, and add the new names to this plan's "Plan amendments" as amendment 19 before continuing. Leave room above them for W03's contract migration.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test** — this task's test is Task 5's replay suite, which cannot be written before the migration exists. The red step here is the guard that DOES run now: assert the file is absent and that the naming guard is clean once it lands. Run, before creating the file:

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql
```

Expected failure: `ls: apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql: No such file or directory`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — create `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql`:

```sql
-- Disk Cleanup v2 W02 — the scan-path axis for filesystem analysis (spec §4,
-- as amended by the Codex quorum findings in spec §13 #7, #8 and #18).
--
-- WHAT THIS FIXES (spec §2 defect 6). Scan state is keyed per DEVICE and
-- snapshots record no path, so a `D:\` scan resets the `C:\` baseline,
-- pollutes its hotDirectories, and becomes the "latest" snapshot that a `C:\`
-- cleanup preview then deletes from.
--
-- EXPAND ONLY (§13 #7). Every column added here is NULLABLE or defaulted, and
-- there is no primary key and no SET NOT NULL. An old API replica still
-- draining during the deploy supplies no `scan_path`; a NOT NULL column would
-- fail its snapshot INSERT with 23502 and lose a completed scan outright.
-- W03 ships the contract half — `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`
-- — once W02 is deployed everywhere.
--
-- SHIPS WITH ITS CODE. `upsertFilesystemScanState` uses
-- `onConflictDoUpdate({ target: deviceId })`; the single-column key is dropped
-- below, so that target names no unique index and every upsert raises 42P10.
-- The API release that carries this migration MUST also carry the writer
-- change. During a multi-replica window old replicas' snapshot inserts keep
-- working (the column is nullable) while their scan-state upserts fail with
-- 42P10 until they drain; a re-run scan repairs that state.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT. Every DDL statement is guarded and every backfill is gated on
-- `scan_path IS NULL`. No inner BEGIN/COMMIT: autoMigrate wraps each file in
-- one transaction.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Transient normalisation helper
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The SQL mirror of `normalizeScanPath(osType, path)` (packages/shared). Both
-- backfills below call it, so the two provably agree instead of carrying two
-- hand-copied CASE chains that can drift. Created and dropped inside this
-- migration: it is a migration-local tool, never part of the schema.
--
-- It does NOT resolve `.`/`..` — impractical set-based SQL. A recorded path
-- carrying a dot segment is returned UNCHANGED, which makes it inert (it
-- matches no normalised read) and lets the next scan supersede it.
-- Deliberately not re-keyed to the OS root, which would fold another volume's
-- cleanup candidates into the root preview.
--
-- A NULL or blank path yields the OS root, so `…(os_type, NULL)` is also how
-- the callers below spell "this device's OS root".

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the naming guard and watch it pass**

```bash
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --staged
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
```

Expected: both exit 0 with no violation lines. If the `--against-ref` run reports that the file does not sort after `origin/main`'s newest, go back to Step 1.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove the RLS-scope guard is satisfied and no baseline entry was added**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`. This is the guard that both backfills' `PERFORM set_config('breeze.scope','system', true)` exists. If it reports the new file as an unscoped offender, fix the migration — **never** add the filename to `UNSCOPED_DML_BASELINE`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the file is discovered and ordered**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)` — the filename matches the runner's `^\d{4}-.*\.sql$` pattern, adds nothing to the closed `2026-08-06` block, and every migration path referenced from `apps/api/src` still resolves.

- [ ] **Step 7: Prove this migration adds no NOT NULL and no primary key (amendment 15)**

```bash
grep -nE 'SET NOT NULL|ADD PRIMARY KEY|PRIMARY KEY \(' apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql
```

Expected: **no output.** This is the expand half; a single `SET NOT NULL` here loses a snapshot for every scan an old replica completes during the deploy (spec §13 #7). The contract half is W03's file.

- [ ] **Step 8: Prove the helper does not leak into the schema**

```bash
grep -c 'DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.breeze_w02_normalize_scan_path' apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql
```

Expected: `2` — once before the `CREATE` (so a half-applied earlier attempt cannot block it) and once at the end of the file. The helper is a migration-local tool and must not survive it.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(db): scan-path axis for filesystem analysis (expand half)

Spec §4 as amended by the Codex quorum findings in §13 (#7, #8, #18).

Adds scan_path to device_filesystem_snapshots / _scan_state / _cleanup_runs,
scan_generation to scan state, kind + command_id to cleanup runs, and swaps the
snapshot index to (device_id, scan_path, captured_at DESC).

EXPAND ONLY. Every column is nullable or defaulted and nothing gains a NOT NULL
or a primary key: an old replica draining during the deploy supplies no
scan_path, and a NOT NULL column would fail its snapshot INSERT with 23502 and
lose a completed scan. The scan-state key becomes a nullable-tolerant UNIQUE
INDEX on (device_id, scan_path) — the single-column key has to go now because
it permits only one row per device. W03 contracts: SET NOT NULL on both columns
and PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX.

Both backfills call ONE migration-local normalisation helper, so the snapshot
and scan-state passes provably agree; the helper is dropped at the end of the
file. A snapshot whose recorded path carries a dot segment is stored verbatim —
it matches no normalised read and the next scan supersedes it — rather than
re-keyed to the OS root, which would fold another volume's candidates into the
root preview.

The scan-state backfill runs in two passes. Pass A adopts the device's newest
snapshot's volume when it still matches a device_disks mount point or the OS
root, keeping the resume state. Pass B labels the row the OS root but CLEARS
checkpoint/aggregate/hot_directories, because that state may belong to another
volume and resuming a D:\ checkpoint into C:\ would reintroduce defect 6 inside
the migration that fixes it. Both counts are reported.

The writer change ships in the same release: once the single-column key is
dropped, onConflictDoUpdate({ target: deviceId }) raises 42P10.

### Task 3: Migration 2 — the `running` cleanup-run status, alone in its file

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `filesystem_cleanup_run_status` enum (`apps/api/migrations/0006-filesystem-analysis.sql:8`).
- Produces: the label `running` on that enum, sorting after `previewed`, `executed`, `failed`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing check**

```bash
ls apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql
```

Expected failure: `ls: apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql: No such file or directory`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement** — create `apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql`:

```sql
-- Disk Cleanup v2 W02: the `running` cleanup-run status (spec §4). W04's
-- system-cleanup route inserts a row with status='running' before the agent
-- answers, so the label has to exist one release earlier than its first writer.
--
-- ENUM ADD ONLY, in its own file: a label added by ALTER TYPE cannot be USED
-- until the transaction that added it commits, and autoMigrate wraps each file
-- in one transaction. Precedent:
-- 2026-10-17-110400-report-type-endpoint-management-review.sql.
--
-- No rows are written, so no breeze.scope election is required. Idempotent.
ALTER TYPE filesystem_cleanup_run_status ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'running';
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the guards and watch them pass**

```bash
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --staged
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts
```

Expected: the two guard scripts exit 0; `Test Files  2 passed (2)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Prove the file contains exactly one statement**

```bash
grep -c ';' apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql
```

Expected: `1`. More than one statement in an enum-add file is the bug this file's separation exists to prevent.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/migrations/2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(db): add the `running` filesystem cleanup-run status

Spec §4. Its own file with a single statement, per the repo convention: a label
added by ALTER TYPE cannot be used in the transaction that adds it, and
autoMigrate wraps each file in one. First writer is W04's system-cleanup route.

### Task 4: Drizzle mirror and the tenant-export policy registry

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/db/schema/filesystem.ts:1-72` (the whole file)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts:230-232`
- Create: `apps/api/src/db/schema/filesystem.test.ts` (Test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `uniqueIndex` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core`. (**Not** `primaryKey` — amendment 16.)
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export const filesystemCleanupRunStatusEnum: PgEnum<['previewed','executed','failed','running']>;
  // deviceFilesystemSnapshots.scanPath: text | null            (NULLABLE in W02, amendment 15)
  // deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns.scanPath: text | null; .kind: text; .commandId: string | null
  // deviceFilesystemScanState.scanPath: text | null; .scanGeneration: string | null
  //   + uniqueIndex('device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx') on (deviceId, scanPath)
  //   and NO primaryKey — W03 promotes the index.
  ```
- **Hands off to W03:** flip both `scanPath` columns to `.notNull()` and replace the `uniqueIndex` with `primaryKey({ name: 'device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey', columns: [table.deviceId, table.scanPath] })` in the same PR as the contract migration.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the export-policy entries** — in `apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts`, replace the three lines at `:230-232` with:

```ts
  // W02 multi-volume (spec §4): scan_path is a normalised path string, kind is
  // a closed catalog value ('files'|'system'), and command_id / scan_generation
  // are plain device_commands identifiers. All four are ordinary

  // operational data — no open container, no SUSPICIOUS_NAME_PARTS hit — so
  // `included`. `plan` and `executed_actions` stay `excludedOpen` (jsonb), so
  // a system run's action list does not appear in a tenant export while kind,
  // status, bytes_reclaimed and requested_at do. Accepted.
  "device_filesystem_cleanup_runs": tablePolicy("org_id", {"included":["id","device_id","org_id","scan_path","kind","command_id","requested_by","requested_at","approved_at","bytes_reclaimed","status","error","created_at","updated_at"],"reviewedIncluded":[],"excludedSensitive":[],"excludedOpen":["plan","executed_actions"]}),
  "device_filesystem_scan_state": tablePolicy("org_id", {"included":["device_id","scan_path","scan_generation","org_id","last_run_mode","last_baseline_completed_at","last_disk_used_percent","created_at","updated_at"],"reviewedIncluded":[],"excludedSensitive":[],"excludedOpen":["checkpoint","aggregate","hot_directories"]}),

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/schema/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 12 tests passed.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the cascade lists genuinely need no change (amendment 11)**

```bash
git grep -n 'device_filesystem' -- apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts
```

Expected: exactly five lines — `tenantCascade.ts:443,444,445` and `routes/devices/core.ts:282,283,588`  (the `core.ts:282-283` pair spans two source lines for three table names). All three tables are already registered in all three device/org cascade lists.

```bash
git grep -n 'device_filesystem' -- apps/api/src/services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts
```

Expected: **no output.** No filesystem table carries a `ticket_id`, so the ticket-move lists do not apply; all three are tenancy shape 1 (direct `org_id`), so no RLS allowlist entry exists or is needed.

- [ ] **Step 7: Typecheck**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
```

Expected: no output. Nothing reads `scanPath` off a row yet — Tasks 9 and 10 introduce those reads and carry the `?? scanPath` fallbacks the nullable column requires (amendment 15). `deviceId` losing `.primaryKey()` is not a type change (it stays `notNull`), and nothing switches exhaustively on the cleanup-run status enum — verified: the only consumers are `routes/devices/filesystem.ts:303`, `services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts:290` and `services/aiAgents/actRevalidation.ts:148`, all of which compare against a single literal.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/db/schema/filesystem.ts apps/api/src/db/schema/filesystem.test.ts apps/api/src/services/tenantExportPolicyRegistry.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(db): mirror the scan-path axis in Drizzle and classify the new columns

Spec §4 as amended by §13 #7 and #18. Nullable scan_path on snapshots and scan
state, scan_generation on scan state, a UNIQUE INDEX (not a primary key) over
(device_id, scan_path), the swapped snapshot index, scan_path/kind/command_id
on cleanup runs, and the fourth cleanup-run status label.

Six new columns classified `included` in CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY — the one
registration list that fires on a new COLUMN rather than a new table, and the
one that otherwise only reddens under Integration Tests. filesystem.test.ts
moves that failure into Test API.

scanPath is `string | null` here by design, so every later reader falls back to
the scan path it asked for — that fallback is what keeps a row written by an
old replica mid-deploy readable.

Cascade lists verified unchanged: all three tables are already in
CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER, CORE_DEVICE_CASCADE_DELETE_TABLES and
CORE_DEVICE_ORG_DENORMALIZED_TABLES; none carries a ticket_id; none is
append-only; all three are tenancy shape 1 so no RLS allowlist applies.

### Task 5: The migration replay proof (live Postgres)

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/filesystemMultiVolumeMigration.integration.test.ts` (Test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `getTestDb`, `./setup`, `createPartner`, `createOrganization`, `createSite` from `./db-utils`, `replayMigration` from `./replayMigration`, and the Drizzle tables from `../../db/schema/filesystem`.
- Produces: nothing importable. This is the live half of the contract that amendment 5 says `db:check-drift` cannot give.

> **Why this suite exists.** CI migrates schema-fresh in `globalSetup`, so both backfills have only ever run against ZERO rows — a green migration says nothing about whether the normalisation is right. This seeds the shapes production actually has, drops the constraint the migration adds, replays the file, and asserts the results. It also pins the PK/index/CHECK/enum shape, which is the half `db:check-drift` explicitly does not check.
>
> `vitest.integration.config.ts` sets `fileParallelism: false`, so the brief window in which `scan_path` is nullable cannot be observed by another suite. `setup.ts` TRUNCATEs `devices` CASCADE on `beforeEach`, which takes the snapshots with it, so every `it()` seeds its own fixtures. The file lives under `src/__tests__/integration/`, which the config's shared glob already covers — no config edit, and `integration-suite-coverage.integration.test.ts` stays green.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — create `apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/filesystemMultiVolumeMigration.integration.test.ts`:

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail** — with a live database up (`pnpm test-stack up`):

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/filesystemMultiVolumeMigration.integration.test.ts
```

Expected failure BEFORE Tasks 2 and 3 are applied to the test database: `column "scan_path" of relation "device_filesystem_snapshots" does not exist`. If Tasks 2 and 3 are already committed, the test database created by `globalSetup` has them, and this run should pass — in that case delete the `scan_path` column by hand first (`ALTER TABLE device_filesystem_snapshots DROP COLUMN scan_path`) to watch it go red, then `pnpm test-stack down && pnpm test-stack up` to get a clean database back.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts src/__tests__/integration/filesystemMultiVolumeMigration.integration.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 21 tests passed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Prove the integration-suite coverage contract is satisfied**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.integration-suite-coverage.ts
```

Expected: pass. The new file sits under `src/__tests__/integration/**`, which the config's shared glob already covers, so no `vitest.integration.config.ts` edit is required.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the export-policy and erasure round-trip suites — the two that fire on a new column**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  3 passed (3)`. These are the suites CLAUDE.md records as catching the missed registration 5/5 while code review caught it 0/5 — and they only run under Integration Tests, so a unit-green PR can still redden main.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the drift check**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="$(grep -E '^DATABASE_URL=' .env.test | cut -d= -f2-)" pnpm db:check-drift
```

Expected: the ledger has one row per migration file on disk, no ordering or idempotency error. (This proves the set applies to a fresh database in filename order; it does NOT compare the Drizzle mirror — see amendment 5.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash

test(db): live proof for the filesystem multi-volume migration

CI migrates schema-fresh, so both backfills have only ever run against zero
rows — a green migration says nothing about whether the normalisation is right.
This seeds the production shapes (lower-case drive, mixed separators, repeated
separators, trailing slash, missing path, dot segment), replays the file, and
asserts the result byte for byte against what normalizeScanPath returns.

Pins the two rollout contracts the quorum found (spec §13 #7, #8): both
scan_path columns stay NULLABLE so an old replica's snapshot insert still
lands, and the scan-state backfill adopts a legacy row's real volume when the
newest snapshot still matches a disk (state kept) but CLEARS
checkpoint/aggregate/hot_directories when it cannot (a D:\ checkpoint is never
relabelled C:\).

Also pins the half db:check-drift explicitly does not check: the unique index
over (device_id, scan_path) with no primary key, that it works as an ON
CONFLICT target, the index swap, the kind CHECK, the four enum labels,
scan_generation, that the migration-local helper is dropped, and that one
device can hold independent state for two volumes.

### Task 6: Move `filesystemAnalysis.ts` onto the `(deviceId, scanPath)` axis

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts:1-7` (imports), `:63-94` (`saveFilesystemSnapshot`), `:96-135` (the three readers), `:137-184` (`upsertFilesystemScanState`), and append `readPlanScanPath`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts` (append two describes)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts:117`, `:167`, `:286`, `:378` (pin callers to the OS root)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts:1623`, `:1652`, `:1670` (pin callers to the OS root)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts:164`, `:186`, `:266` (pin callers to the OS root)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts:1333-1336`, `:1376-1379` (positional destructure, amendment 7)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath` from `@breeze/shared` (Task 1); `and` from `drizzle-orm`.
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export async function saveFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId: string, orgId: string, trigger: FilesystemSnapshotTrigger, scanPath: string, payload: AnyObject);
  export async function getLatestFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId: string, scanPath: string);
  export async function getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId: string, scanPath: string);
  //   -> { id, scanPath, capturedAt, partial, cleanupCandidates } | null
  export async function getFilesystemScanState(deviceId: string, scanPath: string);
  export async function upsertFilesystemScanState(deviceId: string, orgId: string, scanPath: string, updates: {...});
  export function readPlanScanPath(plan: unknown): string | null;
  // Scan generation (amendment 18, spec §13 #18):
  export async function setFilesystemScanGeneration(deviceId: string, scanPath: string, commandId: string): Promise<void>;
  export type ScanGenerationClaim = 'claimed' | 'superseded' | 'already_applied' | 'absent';
  export async function claimFilesystemScanGeneration(deviceId: string, scanPath: string, commandId: string): Promise<ScanGenerationClaim>;
  ```

> **This task is behaviour-preserving on purpose.** Every existing caller is pinned to `osRootScanPath(device.osType)`. Today there is exactly one scan-state row per device and one snapshot stream per device; keying both on the OS root is the SAME row and the SAME stream. Tasks 9–12 then replace the pin with the real per-volume path, one surface at a time, so no task leaves the repo red and each is reviewable on its own.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — append to `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('readPlanScanPath', () => {
  it('reads the scan path a preview pinned into its stored plan', () => {
    expect(readPlanScanPath({ snapshotId: 's', scanPath: 'D:\\', preview: {} })).toBe('D:\\');
  });

  it('returns null for a plan with no pinned path, so the caller can fall back explicitly', () => {
    expect(readPlanScanPath({ snapshotId: 's' })).toBeNull();
    expect(readPlanScanPath(null)).toBeNull();
    expect(readPlanScanPath('not an object')).toBeNull();
    expect(readPlanScanPath({ scanPath: '' })).toBeNull();
    expect(readPlanScanPath({ scanPath: 42 })).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

and append a second describe that pins the conflict target, which is the one thing a mocked unit test CAN see and the one thing that breaks with `42P10` if it regresses:

```ts
describe('upsertFilesystemScanState — conflict target (spec §4 writer contract)', () => {
  it('conflicts on (deviceId, scanPath), not on deviceId alone', async () => {
    const onConflictDoUpdate = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
      returning: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([{ deviceId: 'device-1', scanPath: 'D:\\' }]),
    });
    const values = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ onConflictDoUpdate });
    const insert = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ values });
    vi.mocked(db.insert).mockImplementation(insert as never);

    await upsertFilesystemScanState('device-1', 'org-1', 'D:\\', { lastRunMode: 'baseline' });

    expect(values).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({
      deviceId: 'device-1',
      orgId: 'org-1',
      scanPath: 'D:\\',
    }));
    const target = onConflictDoUpdate.mock.calls[0]![0].target;
    // An array of TWO columns. A single column here is the 42P10 regression:
    // after the primary-key swap, `target: deviceId` names no unique index.
    expect(Array.isArray(target)).toBe(true);
    expect(target).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(target.map((column: { name: string }) => column.name)).toEqual(['device_id', 'scan_path']);
  });
});
```

and a third describe for the scan generation (amendment 18) — this is the contract that stops a superseded scan overwriting a newer checkpoint, and it is the only place a mocked test can see the conditional `WHERE`:

```ts
describe('scan generation (spec §13 #18)', () => {
  function mockUpdateReturning(rows: unknown[]) {
    const returning = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(rows);
    const where = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ returning });
    const set = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ where });
    vi.mocked(db.update).mockReturnValue({ set } as never);
    return { set, where, returning };
  }

  function mockSelectRows(rows: unknown[]) {
    vi.mocked(db.select).mockReturnValue({
      from: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
        where: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ limit: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(rows) }),
      }),
    } as never);
  }

  it('setFilesystemScanGeneration updates the row and never inserts one', async () => {
    const where = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);
    const set = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ where });
    vi.mocked(db.update).mockReturnValue({ set } as never);

    await setFilesystemScanGeneration('device-1', 'D:\\', 'cmd-1');

    // A plain UPDATE, not an upsert: a first-ever scan has no state row yet,
    // and the handler's `absent` branch covers that case by applying the
    // result rather than dropping it.
    expect(db.insert).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(set).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ scanGeneration: 'cmd-1' }));
  });

  it('claims the generation when the command id matches, clearing it in the same statement', async () => {
    const { set } = mockUpdateReturning([{ deviceId: 'device-1' }]);

    await expect(claimFilesystemScanGeneration('device-1', 'D:\\', 'cmd-1')).resolves.toBe('claimed');

    // Nulling it IS the idempotency marker: the same command cannot claim twice.
    expect(set).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ scanGeneration: null }));
  });

  it('reports superseded when a DIFFERENT generation owns the row', async () => {
    mockUpdateReturning([]);
    mockSelectRows([{ scanGeneration: 'cmd-2' }]);

    await expect(claimFilesystemScanGeneration('device-1', 'D:\\', 'cmd-1')).resolves.toBe('superseded');
  });

  it('reports already_applied for a duplicate delivery of the same command', async () => {
    // The claim nulled the generation the first time round, so the second
    // delivery finds a row with no generation and must NOT re-apply.
    mockUpdateReturning([]);
    mockSelectRows([{ scanGeneration: null }]);

    await expect(claimFilesystemScanGeneration('device-1', 'D:\\', 'cmd-1')).resolves.toBe('already_applied');
  });

  it('reports absent when there is no scan-state row at all', async () => {
    mockUpdateReturning([]);
    mockSelectRows([]);

    await expect(claimFilesystemScanGeneration('device-1', 'D:\\', 'cmd-1')).resolves.toBe('absent');
  });
});
```

These describes need the module under test to see a mocked `db`, so add at the TOP of `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts`, above the existing imports:

```ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';

vi.mock('../db', () => ({
  db: { select: vi.fn(), insert: vi.fn(), update: vi.fn() },
}));
```

and extend the existing import from `./filesystemAnalysis` with `readPlanScanPath`, `upsertFilesystemScanState`, `setFilesystemScanGeneration` and `claimFilesystemScanGeneration`, and add `import { db } from '../db';`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `SyntaxError: The requested module './filesystemAnalysis' does not provide an export named 'readPlanScanPath'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the service** — in `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts`, change the import line at `:1` from `import { desc, eq } from 'drizzle-orm';` to:

```ts
import { and, desc, eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
```

Replace `saveFilesystemSnapshot` (`:63-94`) with:

```ts
/**
 * @param scanPath the NORMALISED volume/path this scan covered
 *   (`normalizeScanPath` from `@breeze/shared`). It is the second half of the
 *   key every reader uses — a raw `c:\` here is invisible to a `C:\` read.
 */
export async function saveFilesystemSnapshot(
  deviceId: string,
  orgId: string,
  trigger: FilesystemSnapshotTrigger,
  scanPath: string,
  payload: AnyObject
) {
  const summary = asRecord(payload.summary) ?? {};
  const partial = asBoolean(payload.partial, false);

  const [snapshot] = await db
    .insert(deviceFilesystemSnapshots)
    .values({
      deviceId,
      orgId,

      partial,
      summary,
      largestFiles: asArray(payload.topLargestFiles),
      largestDirs: asArray(payload.topLargestDirectories),
      tempAccumulation: asArray(payload.tempAccumulation),
      oldDownloads: asArray(payload.oldDownloads),

    .returning();

  return snapshot ?? null;
}
```

Replace the three readers (`:96-135`) with:

```ts

  const [snapshot] = await db
    .select()
    .from(deviceFilesystemSnapshots)

    .limit(1);

  return snapshot ?? null;
}

/**

 * which need the snapshot's identity and its cleanup candidates but none of
 * the other large jsonb columns (largest files/dirs, duplicates, the duplicate

 */
export async function getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId: string, scanPath: string) {
  const [snapshot] = await db
    .select({
      id: deviceFilesystemSnapshots.id,

    ))

  return snapshot ?? null;
}

export async function getFilesystemScanState(deviceId: string, scanPath: string) {
  const [state] = await db
    .select()
    .from(deviceFilesystemScanState)
    .where(and(

      eq(deviceFilesystemScanState.scanPath, scanPath),
    ))
    .limit(1);

  return state ?? null;
}
```

Replace `upsertFilesystemScanState`'s signature, insert values and conflict target (`:137-184`):

```ts
export async function upsertFilesystemScanState(
  deviceId: string,
  orgId: string,
  scanPath: string,

  }
) {

    .onConflictDoUpdate({

Append `readPlanScanPath` at the end of the file, next to `readPlanPreviewCandidates`:

```ts

 *    auto-resume continuation plus a user-triggered rescan, or two operators).
 *    Only the command the row currently names can claim it, so a superseded
 *    scan can no longer overwrite a newer run's checkpoint with a stale
 *    frontier.
 *  - IDEMPOTENCY — the claim NULLS the generation, so a duplicate delivery of
 *    the same command id finds nothing to claim and is dropped.
 *
 * `absent` (no state row) applies the result deliberately: a device whose
 * state row has not been created yet, or was removed, must not lose a
 * completed scan to a bookkeeping row that never existed.
 *
 * NOTE: this guards RESULT APPLICATION only. A scan queued between the claim
 * and the handler's final `upsertFilesystemScanState` can still have its row
 * overwritten by the older run's checkpoint — the pre-existing last-writer-wins
 * window, unchanged by this wave and much narrower than the one it closes.

}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Pin the four call-site groups to the OS root (behaviour-preserving)**

In `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts`, add to the imports:

```ts
import { osRootScanPath } from '@breeze/shared';
```

then at `:117` `getLatestFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId, osRootScanPath((device as { osType?: unknown }).osType))`; at `:167` `getFilesystemScanState(deviceId, osRootScanPath((device as { osType?: unknown }).osType))`; at `:286` and `:378` `getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId, osRootScanPath((device as { osType?: unknown }).osType))`.

In `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts`, the handler has no OS in scope until Task 11 adds the `devices.os_type` read, so the pin is a named constant rather than a call. Add it at the top of that file's "Filesystem Analysis" section (above `getFilesystemThresholdScanPath`, `:1516`):

```ts
/**
 * W02 Task 6 transitional pin. The handler has no OS in scope yet (plan
 * amendment 6), and before this wave every snapshot and every scan-state row
 * was device-keyed with no path — which is exactly `'/'` for POSIX devices and
 * `'C:\'` for Windows ones. Task 11 reads `devices.os_type` and replaces this
 * with the normalised `command.payload.path`. Until then the POSIX root
 * preserves today's single-stream behaviour for the majority case and Task 11
 * lands in the same PR, so no deployment ever sees this value.
 */
const W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH = '/';
```

Use `W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH` at `:1623` (the second argument to `getFilesystemScanState`), `:1652` (the new fourth argument to `saveFilesystemSnapshot`) and `:1670` (the new third argument to `upsertFilesystemScanState`). Task 11 deletes the constant, and Task 11's Step 5 greps for it so it cannot survive the wave.

In `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts`, add `import { osRootScanPath } from '@breeze/shared';` and pin `:164` / `:186` / `:266` to `osRootScanPath(access.device.osType)`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Fix the two positional destructures (amendment 7)**

In `apps/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts`, replace both occurrences of

```ts
      const [sfDeviceId, , sfTrigger, sfPayload] =
        vi.mocked(saveFilesystemSnapshot).mock.calls[0]!;
```

with

```ts
      // (deviceId, orgId, trigger, scanPath, payload) since W02 — scanPath is
      // index 3, so the payload moved to index 4.
      const [sfDeviceId, , sfTrigger, , sfPayload] =
        vi.mocked(saveFilesystemSnapshot).mock.calls[0]!;
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run \
  src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts \
  src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts \
  src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts \
  src/routes/agents.test.ts \
  src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.diskCleanupRequestedBy.test.ts \
  src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.fileWriteCap.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  6 passed (6)`. Every path is a full filename — a trailing-slash directory filter would silently skip the dotted siblings (`aiToolsFilesystem.fileWriteCap.test.ts` vs `aiToolsFilesystem/`).

- [ ] **Step 7: Typecheck**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
```

Expected: no output. Every caller of the five changed functions now passes a `scanPath`; the compiler is what proves the sweep is complete.

- [ ] **Step 8: Prove no caller was missed**

```bash
git grep -n 'getLatestFilesystemSnapshot(\|getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(\|getFilesystemScanState(\|upsertFilesystemScanState(\|saveFilesystemSnapshot(' -- apps ee packages | grep -v '\.test\.ts'
```

Expected: matches only in `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts` (the definitions), `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts` and `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts` — and every one of those call sites has two or more arguments.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.test.ts \
  apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts \
  apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(filesystem): key every snapshot and scan-state read/write on a scan path

Spec §4 writer contract. upsertFilesystemScanState's ON CONFLICT target moves
to (deviceId, scanPath) with the primary key — a single-column target names no
unique index after the migration and raises 42P10, which is why the two ship
together.

Behaviour-preserving: every existing caller is pinned to the OS root, which is
the same single row and the same single stream the device-keyed schema had.
Tasks 9-12 replace the pin with the real per-volume path.

Adds readPlanScanPath so cleanup-execute can recover the volume a preview
pinned, and extends getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot with capturedAt/partial
for the volumes list.

### Task 7: `filesystemVolumes.ts` — which disks are scannable, and what we know about each

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/filesystemVolumes.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/filesystemVolumes.test.ts` (Test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath` (`@breeze/shared`); `db`, `deviceDisks`; `buildCleanupPreview`, `getFilesystemScanState`, `getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot`, `readCheckpointPendingDirectories` (`./filesystemAnalysis`).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export const NON_SCANNABLE_FS_TYPES: ReadonlySet<string>;
  export const MAX_VOLUMES_PER_DEVICE = 24;
  export type FilesystemVolume = {
    mountPoint: string; scanPath: string; fsType: string | null;
    totalGb: number | null; usedGb: number | null; freeGb: number | null; usedPercent: number | null;
    isOsRoot: boolean;
    scanState: { lastRunMode: string; lastBaselineCompletedAt: string | null; hasCheckpoint: boolean } | null;
    latestSnapshot: { id: string; capturedAt: string; partial: boolean; cleanupEstimateBytes: number } | null;
  };
  export function isScannableVolume(volume: { mountPoint?: string | null; fsType?: string | null }, osType: unknown): boolean;
  export function listFilesystemVolumes(deviceId: string, osType: unknown): Promise<FilesystemVolume[]>;
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — create `apps/api/src/services/filesystemVolumes.test.ts`:

```ts
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

feat(filesystem): volumes service — which disks are scannable and their state

Spec §5.1. Turns device_disks rows into scan-path-keyed volumes, refusing
read-only media, memory and kernel filesystems, container/network mounts,
every fuse* variant and Windows UNC mount points — deleting through a network
mount frees space on a machine that is not the one being cleaned.

The OS root is always offered even when the device has reported no disks, so a
fresh endpoint can still be bootstrapped; its capacity stays null rather than
zero so the scan route reads it as "no delta available, take a baseline".

Nothing routes to it yet.

### Task 8: `GET /devices/:id/filesystem/volumes`

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts` (imports; new route after the `GET /:id/filesystem` handler that ends at `:145`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts` (mock block at `:57-68`; new describe)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `listFilesystemVolumes` (Task 7); `authMiddleware`, `requireScope`, `requirePermission`, `PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_READ`; `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck`.
- Produces: `GET /devices/:id/filesystem/volumes` → `200 { data: FilesystemVolume[] }`, `403` on site denial, `404` on unknown device.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — in `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts`, add a mock for the new service above the existing imports:

```ts
vi.mock('../../services/filesystemVolumes', () => ({
  listFilesystemVolumes: vi.fn(),
}));
```

extend the import block with `import { listFilesystemVolumes } from '../../services/filesystemVolumes';`, and append this describe:

```ts
describe('GET /devices/:id/filesystem/volumes (spec §5.1)', () => {
  it('returns the scannable volumes for the device', async () => {
    vi.mocked(getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck).mockResolvedValue({
      id: deviceId, orgId: 'org-123', hostname: 'host-1', osType: 'windows',
    } as never);
    vi.mocked(listFilesystemVolumes).mockResolvedValue([
      {
        mountPoint: 'C:\\', scanPath: 'C:\\', fsType: 'NTFS',
        totalGb: 500, usedGb: 400, freeGb: 100, usedPercent: 80, isOsRoot: true,
        scanState: { lastRunMode: 'baseline', lastBaselineCompletedAt: null, hasCheckpoint: false },
        latestSnapshot: null,
      },
      {
        mountPoint: 'D:\\', scanPath: 'D:\\', fsType: 'NTFS',
        totalGb: 2000, usedGb: 100, freeGb: 1900, usedPercent: 5, isOsRoot: false,
        scanState: null,
        latestSnapshot: { id: 'snap-d', capturedAt: '2026-09-19T09:00:00.000Z', partial: false, cleanupEstimateBytes: 4096 },
      },
    ] as never);

    const res = await app.request(`/devices/${deviceId}/filesystem/volumes`, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' },
    });

    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    const body = await res.json();
    expect(body.data.map((v: { scanPath: string }) => v.scanPath)).toEqual(['C:\\', 'D:\\']);
    expect(body.data[0].isOsRoot).toBe(true);
    // The device's OS decides how a mount point normalises, so it must reach
    // the service — a POSIX default would key a Windows device on '/'.
    expect(listFilesystemVolumes).toHaveBeenCalledWith(deviceId, 'windows');
  });

  it('denies the volumes list when site scope excludes the device', async () => {
    vi.mocked(getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck).mockResolvedValue(SITE_ACCESS_DENIED as never);

    const res = await app.request(`/devices/${deviceId}/filesystem/volumes`, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' },
    });

    expect(res.status).toBe(403);
    expect(listFilesystemVolumes).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it('404s for an unknown device without touching the service', async () => {
    vi.mocked(getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck).mockResolvedValue(null as never);

    const res = await app.request(`/devices/${deviceId}/filesystem/volumes`, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' },
    });

    expect(res.status).toBe(404);
    expect(listFilesystemVolumes).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `expected 404 to be 200` on the first case — the route does not exist, so Hono's fallback answers.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — in `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts`, add to the imports:

```ts
import { listFilesystemVolumes } from '../../services/filesystemVolumes';
```

and add this route immediately after the `GET '/:id/filesystem'` handler:

```ts
/**
 * The volumes a disk-cleanup scan can target (spec §5.1). Sourced from the
 * `device_disks` inventory the agent already reports, filtered to what is
 * actually scannable, and annotated with the per-volume scan state and latest
 * snapshot so the tab can render a chip worth clicking.
 *
 * DEVICES_READ, like every other read here — listing mount points and their
 * capacity reveals nothing a device detail page does not already show.
 */
filesystemRoutes.get(
  '/:id/filesystem/volumes',
  requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'),
  requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_READ.resource, PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_READ.action),
  zValidator('param', deviceIdParamSchema),
  async (c) => {
    const auth = c.get('auth');
    const { id: deviceId } = c.req.valid('param');

    const device = await getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck(c, deviceId, auth);
    if (device === SITE_ACCESS_DENIED) {
      return c.json({ error: 'Access to this site denied' }, 403);
    }
    if (!device) {
      return c.json({ error: 'Device not found' }, 404);
    }

    const volumes = await listFilesystemVolumes(deviceId, (device as { osType?: unknown }).osType);
    return c.json({ data: volumes });
  }
);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 11 tests passed (the 8 that existed plus the 3 above).

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove the route is reachable under its mount and respects site scope**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.site-scope-coverage.ts
```

Expected: pass. The static scan checks every route under `src/routes/**` calls a site-scope helper; the new handler uses `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck` like its siblings.

assuming the OS root. DEVICES_READ, site-scoped like every other read here.

### Task 9: Per-volume snapshot reads, real root detection, and the disk-percent delta fix

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts:1-9` (imports), `:80-98` (delete `readCurrentDiskUsedPercent` and `getDefaultScanPathForOs`), `:100-145` (the GET), `:147-264` (the scan route)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts` (extend the scan describes)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath` (`@breeze/shared`); `listFilesystemVolumes` (Task 7).
- Produces: `GET /devices/:id/filesystem?path=` → the latest snapshot **for that scan path**, response gains `scanPath`. `POST /devices/:id/filesystem/scan` normalises `path`, decides `isRootScopedScan` against the volume list, reads scan state by `(deviceId, scanPath)`, and takes the disk percent from the matching volume.

> **Defects closed here.** Defect 6's `=== 'C:\\'` root check (`:178`) — `c:\` never auto-resumed its own checkpoint, and `D:\` was never treated as a root at all. Defect 8's disk-percent comparison (`:80-88`) — `readCurrentDiskUsedPercent` takes `ORDER BY used_percent DESC LIMIT 1`, i.e. the **fullest disk on the device**, and compares it to a baseline recorded from an arbitrary row (`helpers.ts:1622-1628`), so a device with a nearly-full second disk forced a full baseline on every scan of its first.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `AssertionError: expected "getLatestFilesystemSnapshot" to have been called with [ '1111…', 'D:\\' ]` — the GET still passes `osRootScanPath(...)` from Task 6's pin, and the scan route still compares `payload.path === getDefaultScanPathForOs(...)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — in `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts`:

Change the drizzle import (`:4`) and the schema import (`:6`), and add the shared helper:

```ts
import { and, eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { db } from '../../db';
import { deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns } from '../../db/schema';
import { normalizeScanPath, osRootScanPath } from '@breeze/shared';
```

(`desc` and `deviceDisks` lose their last consumer when `readCurrentDiskUsedPercent` goes.)

Delete `readCurrentDiskUsedPercent` (`:80-88`) and `getDefaultScanPathForOs` (`:95-98`) entirely. Keep `withinPercentDelta` (`:90-93`) unchanged — its `current === null` branch is exactly the "no delta available → baseline" behaviour the spec asks for, and Task 7 made `usedPercent` nullable so that branch is now reachable for real.

Add the query schema next to the other schemas:

```ts
const filesystemSnapshotQuerySchema = z.object({
  /** Which volume's latest snapshot to read. Defaults to the device's OS root. */
  path: z.string().min(1).max(2048).optional(),
});
```

Rewrite the `GET '/:id/filesystem'` handler's validator list and body:

```ts
filesystemRoutes.get(
  '/:id/filesystem',
  requireScope('organization', 'partner', 'system'),
  requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_READ.resource, PERMISSIONS.DEVICES_READ.action),
  zValidator('param', deviceIdParamSchema),
  zValidator('query', filesystemSnapshotQuerySchema),
  async (c) => {
    const auth = c.get('auth');
    const { id: deviceId } = c.req.valid('param');
    const { path: requestedPath } = c.req.valid('query');

    const device = await getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck(c, deviceId, auth);
    if (device === SITE_ACCESS_DENIED) {
      return c.json({ error: 'Access to this site denied' }, 403);
    }
    if (!device) {
      return c.json({ error: 'Device not found' }, 404);
    }

    const osType = (device as { osType?: unknown }).osType;
    const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(osType, requestedPath ?? osRootScanPath(osType));

    const snapshot = await getLatestFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId, scanPath);
    if (!snapshot) {
      return c.json({ error: 'No filesystem analysis available yet', scanPath }, 404);
    }

    return c.json({
      data: {
        id: snapshot.id,
        deviceId: snapshot.deviceId,
        // The normalised key this snapshot is stored under — what the client
        // sends back on the next request. `path` below is the raw string the
        // agent actually walked, which the tab has always displayed.
        //
        // `?? scanPath` because the column is nullable in W02 (amendment 15),
        // and the ONE shape that produces a null is a row an old API replica
        // wrote mid-deploy. The row was SELECTed by `scanPath`, so the
        // fallback is exact rather than a guess.
        scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
        capturedAt: snapshot.capturedAt,
        trigger: snapshot.trigger,
        partial: snapshot.partial,
        reason: readSnapshotReason(snapshot),
        path: readSnapshotPath(snapshot),
        scanMode: readSnapshotScanMode(snapshot),
        summary: snapshot.summary,
        topLargestFiles: snapshot.largestFiles,
        topLargestDirectories: snapshot.largestDirs,
        tempAccumulation: snapshot.tempAccumulation,
        oldDownloads: snapshot.oldDownloads,
        unrotatedLogs: snapshot.unrotatedLogs,
        trashUsage: snapshot.trashUsage,
        duplicateCandidates: snapshot.duplicateCandidates,
        cleanupCandidates: snapshot.cleanupCandidates,
        errors: snapshot.errors,
      },
    });
  }
);
```

In the scan handler, replace everything from the `const scanState = …` line (`:167`) down to the `const fullRescanDeltaPercent = 3;` line (`:171`) with:

```ts
    const osType = (device as { osType?: unknown }).osType;
    const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(osType, payload.path);

    // One read serves three jobs: root detection, the disk-percent baseline,
    // and the guarantee that we never scan a volume the volumes endpoint would
    // not offer. `listFilesystemVolumes` always includes the OS root, so a
    // device with no disk inventory can still be bootstrapped.
    const volumes = await listFilesystemVolumes(deviceId, osType);
    const scannedVolume = volumes.find((volume) => volume.scanPath === scanPath) ?? null;

    const scanState = await getFilesystemScanState(deviceId, scanPath);
    const hotDirectories = readHotDirectories(scanState?.hotDirectories, 12);
    const checkpointDirs = readCheckpointPendingDirectories(scanState?.checkpoint, 50_000);
    // Defect 8: compare the SCANNED volume against its own baseline. The old
    // code took `ORDER BY used_percent DESC LIMIT 1` — the fullest disk on the
    // device — so a nearly-full second disk forced a full baseline on every
    // scan of the first. Null here means "no delta available", and
    // `withinPercentDelta` reads that as a baseline, which is the safe answer.
    const currentUsedPercent = scannedVolume?.usedPercent ?? null;
    const fullRescanDeltaPercent = 3;
```

and replace the `isRootScopedScan` line (`:178`) with:

```ts
    // Defect 6: root detection used to be `payload.path === 'C:\\'`, so `c:\`
    // never resumed its own checkpoint and `D:\` was never a root at all. A
    // scan is root-scoped when its normalised path IS one of this device's
    // volume roots.
    const isRootScopedScan = scannedVolume !== null;
```

In the command payload (`:208-217`), replace `...payload,` with an explicit spread that carries the normalised path:

```ts
    const commandPayload = {
      ...payload,
      // The agent receives the NORMALISED form, so the result handler can key
      // the snapshot on `command.payload.path` without re-deriving anything.
      path: scanPath,
      timeoutSeconds,
      trigger: 'on_demand',
      scanMode,
      checkpoint: checkpointPayload,
      targetDirectories,
      autoContinue: scanMode === 'baseline' ? autoContinue : false,
      resumeAttempt: 0,
    };
```

Record this volume's scan generation immediately after the successful `queueCommandForExecution`, above `writeRouteAudit` (`:237`):

```ts
    // Amendment 18 / spec §13 #18. Two scans of the SAME volume can be in
    // flight at once (an auto-resume continuation plus a user-triggered
    // rescan, or two operators), and without a generation the later result
    // overwrites the earlier one's checkpoint with a stale frontier. A plain
    // UPDATE, not an upsert: a first-ever scan has no state row yet and the
    // result handler's `absent` branch applies that result rather than
    // dropping it.
    await setFilesystemScanGeneration(deviceId, scanPath, queued.command.id);
```

(add `setFilesystemScanGeneration` to the `../../services/filesystemAnalysis` import.)

Add `setFilesystemScanGeneration: vi.fn()` to the `vi.mock('../../services/filesystemAnalysis', …)` factory at `:57-68` of `filesystem.test.ts` and import it, or the two assertions in Step 1 have nothing to watch.

Add `scanPath` to the audit details (`:243-249`, replacing `path: payload.path,`):

```ts
        path: scanPath,
        scanPath,
```

and to the 202 response body (`:254-261`):

```ts
      data: {
        commandId: queued.command.id,
        status: queued.command.status,
        createdAt: queued.command.createdAt,
        scanPath,
        scanMode,
        strategy,
      },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 18 tests passed. The pre-existing `runs on-demand scan and persists snapshot` case asserts `expect.objectContaining({ path: '/tmp', scanMode: 'baseline' })` — it uses an `osType`-less device fixture, so `normalizeScanPath(undefined, '/tmp')` is `'/tmp'` and the assertion still holds unchanged. If it fails, the device fixture needs `osType`, not the assertion.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove nothing still reaches for the deleted helpers**

```bash
git grep -n 'readCurrentDiskUsedPercent\|getDefaultScanPathForOs' -- apps
```

Expected: **no output.**

- [ ] **Step 6: Typecheck and commit**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
git add apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(api): read and scan filesystem per volume (defects 6 and 8)

GET /devices/:id/filesystem takes ?path= and answers with that volume's latest
snapshot, echoing the normalised scanPath alongside the raw path the agent
walked.

POST /filesystem/scan normalises the requested path, sends the normalised form
to the agent, and keys scan state on it. Root detection stops being
`=== 'C:\\'` — a scan is root-scoped when its normalised path is one of THIS
device's volume roots, so `c:\` resumes its own checkpoint and `D:\` counts as
a root (defect 6).

The disk-percent baseline now comes from the scanned volume's own row instead
of `ORDER BY used_percent DESC LIMIT 1` — the fullest disk on the device — which
forced a full baseline on every scan of a machine with a nearly-full second
disk (defect 8). No matching row means no delta, which means a baseline.

### Task 10: Pin the volume into the cleanup preview, and thread it through execute

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts:44-46` (`cleanupPreviewBodySchema`), `:266-329` (preview), `:331-471` (execute)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts` (extend the preview/execute describes)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `readPlanScanPath` (Task 6); `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath`.
- Produces: `POST /filesystem/cleanup-preview { path?, categories? }` → response gains `scanPath`, and the stored run gets `scan_path` plus `plan.scanPath`. `POST /filesystem/cleanup-execute` → response gains `scanPath`, and the stored run gets `scan_path` plus `plan.scanPath`.

> **Scope.** §5.2's other execute changes — required `cleanupRunId`, `rejectedPaths`, per-path `status`, the `CLEANUP_EXECUTE_BUDGET_MS` budget, the `permanent`/`cleanupGuard`/`contentsOnly` dispatch payload — belong to W01 and W03. This task threads the volume and nothing else (amendment 10).

Add `readPlanScanPath: vi.fn(() => null)` to the `vi.mock('../../services/filesystemAnalysis', …)` factory at `:57-68`, and import it alongside `readPlanPreviewCandidates`. For the two pinned-lane cases above, set `vi.mocked(readPlanScanPath).mockReturnValue('D:\\')`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `AssertionError: expected undefined to be 'D:\\'` on `body.data.scanPath` — the preview response has no such field yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** — in `apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts`:

Add `readPlanScanPath` to the `../../services/filesystemAnalysis` import, and extend `cleanupPreviewBodySchema` (`:44-46`):

```ts
const cleanupPreviewBodySchema = z.object({
  /** Which volume to preview. Defaults to the device's OS root. */
  path: z.string().min(1).max(2048).optional(),
  categories: z.array(z.enum(['temp_files', 'browser_cache', 'package_cache', 'trash'])).max(10).optional(),
});
```

In the preview handler, replace the destructure and the snapshot read:

```ts
    const { path: requestedPath, categories } = c.req.valid('json');
    // …device checks unchanged…
    const osType = (device as { osType?: unknown }).osType;
    const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(osType, requestedPath ?? osRootScanPath(osType));

    const snapshot = await getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId, scanPath);
    if (!snapshot) {
      // Message kept verbatim: the docs troubleshooting section and existing
      // clients match on this string. The scanPath echo is what tells the
      // caller WHICH volume has no snapshot.
      return c.json({ error: 'No filesystem snapshot available. Run a scan first.', scanPath }, 404);
    }
```

then pin the volume on the stored run and echo it:

```ts
      .values({
        deviceId,
        orgId: device.orgId,
        // `?? scanPath` because the column is nullable in W02 (amendment 15):
        // the row was SELECTed BY `scanPath`, so the fallback is exact, and it
        // keeps a snapshot an old replica wrote mid-deploy previewable.
        scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
        requestedBy: auth.user.id,
        plan: {
          snapshotId: snapshot.id,
          // Pinned alongside snapshotId so execute can recover the volume
          // without a `path` field of its own (spec §5.2).
          scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
          categories: categories ?? safeCleanupCategories,
          preview,
        },
        status: 'previewed',
      })
```

add `scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath` to the audit `details`, and to the 200 body:

```ts
    return c.json({
      success: true,
      data: {
        cleanupRunId: cleanupRun?.id ?? null,
        scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
        ...preview,
      },
    });
```

In the execute handler, resolve the volume in both lanes. Replace the `let candidates … } else { … }` block's declarations and both branches:

```ts
    const osType = (device as { osType?: unknown }).osType;

    let candidates: FilesystemCleanupCandidate[];
    let sourceSnapshotId: string | null = null;
    let scanPath: string;
    if (cleanupRunId) {
      const [run] = await db
        .select({
          plan: deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns.plan,
          scanPath: deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns.scanPath,
        })
        .from(deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns)
        .where(and(
          eq(deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns.id, cleanupRunId),
          eq(deviceFilesystemCleanupRuns.deviceId, deviceId),
        ))
        .limit(1);
      if (!run) {
        return c.json({ error: 'Cleanup run not found' }, 404);
      }
      candidates = readPlanPreviewCandidates(run.plan);
      if (candidates.length === 0) {
        return c.json({
          error: 'Pinned cleanup run has no previewable candidates (it may already be executed or its preview is unavailable). Re-run the cleanup preview.',
        }, 400);
      }
      // The column first, then the plan (rows previewed before this wave have
      // a null column), then the OS root. Never a guess from the candidates.
      scanPath = run.scanPath ?? readPlanScanPath(run.plan) ?? osRootScanPath(osType);
    } else {
      // W02 narrows this lane from "the newest snapshot of ANY path" — which
      // is defect 6 — to the OS root. W03 makes cleanupRunId required and
      // deletes the lane.
      scanPath = osRootScanPath(osType);
      const snapshot = await getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId, scanPath);
      if (!snapshot) {
        return c.json({ error: 'No filesystem snapshot available. Run a scan first.', scanPath }, 404);
      }
      sourceSnapshotId = snapshot.id;
      candidates = buildCleanupPreview(snapshot).candidates;
    }
```

then record and echo it — in the run insert:

```ts
      .values({
        deviceId,
        orgId: device.orgId,
        scanPath,
        requestedBy: auth.user.id,
        approvedAt: new Date(),
        plan: {
          snapshotId: sourceSnapshotId,
          scanPath,
          sourceCleanupRunId: cleanupRunId ?? null,
          requestedPaths: requested,
          selectedPaths: selected.map((candidate) => candidate.path),
        },
        executedActions: actions,
        bytesReclaimed,
        status: runStatus,
        error: failedCount > 0 ? `${failedCount} cleanup action(s) failed` : null,
      })
```

add `scanPath` to the audit `details`, and to the response body:

```ts
      data: {
        cleanupRunId: cleanupRun?.id ?? null,
        scanPath,
        status: runStatus,
        bytesReclaimed,
        selectedCount: selected.length,
        failedCount,
        actions,
      },
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 23 tests passed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Typecheck and commit**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
git add apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/filesystem.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(api): pin the volume into the cleanup preview and carry it through execute

Spec §5.2. cleanup-preview takes an optional `path`, reads that volume's
snapshot, writes scan_path on the run and scanPath into the pinned plan, and
echoes it. cleanup-execute recovers the volume from the run's column (falling
back to the plan for rows previewed before this wave), records it on the new
run, and echoes it.

The unpinned execute lane narrows from "the newest snapshot of ANY path" to the
OS root — that widening IS defect 6. W03 makes cleanupRunId required and
deletes the lane. Everything else in §5.2 (rejectedPaths, the budget, the
dispatch payload) stays with W01/W03.

### Task 11: The agent result handler keys on the scanned volume

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts:1517-1520` (`getFilesystemThresholdScanPath`), `:1564` (the threshold queue payload), `:1593-1679` (the result handler), and delete `W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH` from Task 6
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts` (extend)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath` (`@breeze/shared`); `claimFilesystemScanGeneration`, `setFilesystemScanGeneration` (Task 6); `devices`, `deviceDisks` (already imported in that file).
- Produces: `handleFilesystemAnalysisCommandResult` writes the snapshot and the scan state under `normalizeScanPath(osType, command.payload.path)`, and only after claiming that volume's scan generation; `getFilesystemThresholdScanPath(osType)` returns the normalised OS root; the threshold queue and the auto-resume continuation both record their new generation; the continuation-suppression read is scoped to the same `scan_path`.

> **Why the extra query (amendment 6).** Normalisation is OS-dependent and this handler has no OS in scope: it is called with `agent.orgId` only, and `AgentAuthContext` carries no OS. One indexed primary-key lookup on `devices` is the cost; guessing POSIX would silently key every Windows device on `/` and re-create defect 6 inside the fix.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `AssertionError: expected "saveFilesystemSnapshot" to have been called with [ …, 'D:\\', … ]` — Task 6's `W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH` is still `'/'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

First extend the suite's service mock so the new functions exist — in `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts`, add to the `vi.mock('../../services/filesystemAnalysis', …)` factory (`:57-65`) and to the import below it:

```ts
  claimFilesystemScanGeneration: vi.fn(async () => 'claimed'),
  setFilesystemScanGeneration: vi.fn(),
```

Then in `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts`:

Add `normalizeScanPath, osRootScanPath` to the `@breeze/shared` import, add `claimFilesystemScanGeneration` and `setFilesystemScanGeneration` to the `../../services/filesystemAnalysis` import, delete the `W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH` constant Task 6 added, and replace `getFilesystemThresholdScanPath` (`:1517-1520`):

```ts
/**
 * The volume a threshold-triggered scan targets: the device's OS root, in the
 * same normalised form every other producer uses, so the result handler keys
 * its snapshot on the key a `GET /filesystem` with no `?path=` reads back.
 */
export function getFilesystemThresholdScanPath(osType: unknown): string {
  return osRootScanPath(osType);
}
```

(The `:1564` call site is unchanged — it already passes `device.osType` — and the queued payload's `path` is therefore already normalised. The threshold COOLDOWN at `:1530-1562` stays device-wide on purpose: a scan of any volume in the last N minutes is evidence the device is already being looked at, and per-volume cooldowns would let a 6-volume server queue 6 threshold scans at once.)

The threshold insert must also record its generation, or the result it produces is dropped as `superseded` whenever a row already exists. Change the `db.insert(deviceCommands)` at `:1565-1584` to return its id and follow it with the generation write:

```ts
  const [thresholdCommand] = await db.insert(deviceCommands).values({
    // …the payload block is unchanged…
  }).returning({ id: deviceCommands.id });

  if (thresholdCommand) {
    await setFilesystemScanGeneration(device.id, path, thresholdCommand.id);
  }
```

Replace the body of `handleFilesystemAnalysisCommandResult` from the `// orgId comes from…` comment (`:1617`) through the `currentDiskUsedPercent` assignment (`:1631`):

```ts
  // orgId comes from the caller's agent-auth context, which already resolved
  // the device's org — no need to re-query it here. The OS, however, is not in
  // that context (AgentAuthContext carries no OS), and the scan-path key is
  // OS-dependent: guessing POSIX would key every Windows device on '/' and
  // recreate the very defect this wave closes. One indexed primary-key lookup.
  const [deviceRow] = await db
    .select({ osType: devices.osType })
    .from(devices)
    .where(eq(devices.id, command.deviceId))
    .limit(1);

  if (!deviceRow) {
    console.warn(
      `[agents/helpers] filesystem_analysis command ${command.id} has no devices row for ${command.deviceId}; no snapshot written`
    );
    return;
  }

  const osType = deviceRow.osType;
  // Every producer (the scan route, the AI tool, the threshold queue) already
  // sends the normalised form; normalising again is what makes an in-flight
  // command queued by the PREVIOUS release land on the right key too.
  const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(osType, asString(payload.path) ?? osRootScanPath(osType));

  // Claim this volume's scan generation BEFORE anything is written (spec §13
  // #18). `claimed` is the only outcome that owns the row; `absent` applies
  // anyway rather than losing a completed scan to a bookkeeping row that does
  // not exist yet. `superseded` and `already_applied` are dropped, which is
  // what makes application exclusive and idempotent.
  const claim = await claimFilesystemScanGeneration(command.deviceId, scanPath, command.id);
  if (claim === 'superseded' || claim === 'already_applied') {
    console.warn(
      `[agents/helpers] filesystem_analysis command ${command.id} (device ${command.deviceId}, path ${scanPath}) dropped: ${claim}`
    );
    return;
  }

  // The scan-state read and the disk-usage read are independent; run them
  // together. The disk figure is only consumed by the scan-state upsert below.
  const [currentState, diskRows] = await Promise.all([
    getFilesystemScanState(command.deviceId, scanPath),
    db
      .select({
        mountPoint: deviceDisks.mountPoint,
        usedPercent: deviceDisks.usedPercent,
      })
      .from(deviceDisks)
      .where(eq(deviceDisks.deviceId, command.deviceId))
      .limit(64),
  ]);

  // Defect 8: match the SCANNED volume's own disk row. The old code took
  // `LIMIT 1` — an arbitrary row — so a `D:\` scan recorded `C:`'s 80% as D's
  // baseline and every later `D:\` scan read a huge delta and forced a full
  // rescan. No match means no figure, which means the next scan takes a
  // baseline rather than comparing against an unrelated disk.
  const matchedDisk = diskRows.find(
    (disk) => normalizeScanPath(osType, disk.mountPoint) === scanPath
  );
  const currentDiskUsedPercent =
    typeof matchedDisk?.usedPercent === 'number' ? matchedDisk.usedPercent : null;
```

Pass `scanPath` to the two writers — `:1652` becomes:

```ts
  await saveFilesystemSnapshot(command.deviceId, orgId, snapshotTrigger, scanPath, snapshotPayload);
```

and `:1670` becomes:

```ts
  await upsertFilesystemScanState(command.deviceId, orgId, scanPath, {
```

Scope the continuation-suppression probe to this volume (`:1695-1705`). Today it matches any in-flight `filesystem_analysis` on the DEVICE, so a running `C:\` scan silently cancels a `D:\` baseline's auto-resume and that baseline never finishes (amendment 18):

```ts
  const [inFlightScan] = await db
    .select({ id: deviceCommands.id })
    .from(deviceCommands)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(deviceCommands.deviceId, command.deviceId),
        eq(deviceCommands.type, filesystemAnalysisCommandType),
        // Scan-path scoped: a C:\ scan must not suppress a D:\ continuation.
        // Producers write the NORMALISED path into the payload, so this is an
        // equality test, not a pattern match.
        sql`${deviceCommands.payload}->>'path' = ${scanPath}`,
        sql`${deviceCommands.status} IN ('pending', 'sent')`
      )
    )
    .limit(1);
```

Finally, in the auto-resume block, make the resumed command carry the same normalised key and record its own generation (`:1711-1739`):

```ts
  const nextPayload: Record<string, unknown> = {
    ...(isObject(payload) ? payload : {}),
    // Normalised, so the resumed run's result lands on the SAME scan-state row
    // this one just checkpointed.
    path: scanPath,
    scanMode: 'baseline',
    checkpoint: { pendingDirs },
    autoContinue: true,
    resumeAttempt: resumeAttempt + 1,
  };
```

and after EACH of the two ways the continuation can be created — the `queueCommandForExecution` success branch and the direct `db.insert(deviceCommands)` fallback — record the new generation before returning. Change the success branch from `if (queued.command) { return; }` to:

```ts
  if (queued.command) {
    // The continuation owns this volume from here. Without it, the claim in
    // this same handler has already nulled the generation, so the
    // continuation's own result would come back as `already_applied` and be
    // dropped — the resumed baseline would never complete.
    await setFilesystemScanGeneration(command.deviceId, scanPath, queued.command.id);
    return;
  }
```

and give the fallback insert the same treatment:

```ts
  const [fallbackCommand] = await db.insert(deviceCommands).values({
    deviceId: command.deviceId,
    type: filesystemAnalysisCommandType,
    payload: nextPayload,
    status: 'pending',
    createdBy: command.createdBy,
  }).returning({ id: deviceCommands.id });

  if (fallbackCommand) {
    await setFilesystemScanGeneration(command.deviceId, scanPath, fallbackCommand.id);
  }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts src/routes/agents.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  2 passed (2)`. Two fixture adjustments, neither of which is an assertion change:
- The four pre-existing cases in `helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts` each push one `selectQueue` entry for the disks read; they now need a `devices` entry pushed FIRST — add `selectQueue.push([{ osType: 'linux' }]);` ahead of each existing `selectQueue.push([{ usedPercent: … }]);` and change those entries to `[{ mountPoint: '/', usedPercent: … }]`.
- `claimFilesystemScanGeneration` defaults to `'claimed'` in the mock factory, so every pre-existing case applies its result exactly as before; only the four new drop/absent cases override it.

The cases still assert baseline completion and orgId threading exactly as before.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove the transitional pin is gone**

```bash
git grep -n 'W02_TRANSITIONAL_SCAN_PATH' -- apps
```

Expected: **no output.**

- [ ] **Step 6: Typecheck and commit**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
git add apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.filesystemAnalysis.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(agents): key filesystem results on the volume that was scanned

Spec §5.1 plus §13 #18. The result handler resolves the device's OS
(AgentAuthContext carries none — one indexed PK lookup), normalises
command.payload.path, and writes the snapshot and the scan state under that
key. A result whose device row cannot be resolved writes nothing rather than
guessing POSIX and keying a Windows device on '/'.

It then CLAIMS that volume's scan generation before writing anything. Two scans
of one volume can be in flight at once (an auto-resume continuation plus a
user-triggered rescan), and the later result used to overwrite the earlier
one's checkpoint with a stale frontier. The claim nulls the generation in the
same statement, so application is exclusive AND idempotent: a superseded
generation and a duplicate delivery are both logged and dropped. A device with
no scan-state row still applies, so no completed scan is lost to missing
bookkeeping. The threshold queue and both continuation paths record their own
generation.

Also fixes a defect the generation work exposed: the continuation-suppression
probe matched any in-flight filesystem_analysis on the DEVICE, so a running C:\
scan silently cancelled a D:\ baseline's auto-resume and that baseline never
finished. It is now scoped to payload->>'path'.

The disk-percent baseline comes from the disk whose mount point IS the scanned
volume, instead of an arbitrary `LIMIT 1` row: a D:\ scan used to record C:'s
80% as D's baseline, so every later D:\ scan read a huge delta and forced a
full rescan (defect 8). No matching row means no figure, which means a
baseline.

A resumed checkpoint carries the same normalised path, so the resumed run lands
on the row the previous one checkpointed.

### Task 12: `path` on the `analyze_disk_usage` and `disk_cleanup` AI tools

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemas.ts:998-1007` (`disk_cleanup`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts:13-27` (imports), `:151-221` (`analyze_disk_usage` handler), `:227-375` (`disk_cleanup` definition + handler)
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.scanPath.test.ts` (Test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `normalizeScanPath`, `osRootScanPath` (`@breeze/shared`); `safePath` (already defined in `aiToolSchemas.ts:79-89`).
- Produces: `disk_cleanup` accepts `path`; both handlers normalise it, read and write per volume, and echo `scanPath` in their JSON.

> **Scope.** Spec §9's other items — the required `cleanupRunId`, the empty-snapshot guard, the run-level audit, the new `system_cleanup` tool, and every tier/registry/label/timeout entry — are W05. This task changes the schema and the two handlers only. No registry file is touched, so `agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts` and `aiGuardrails.agentPrincipal.contract.test.ts` stay green without edits.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — create `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.scanPath.test.ts`:

```ts
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

/**
 * `registerFilesystemTools(aiTools: Map<string, AiTool>)` fills a Map keyed by

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.scanPath.test.ts
```

Expected failure: `AssertionError: expected "getLatestFilesystemSnapshot" to have been called with [ '1111…', 'D:\\' ]` — Task 6's pin still passes `osRootScanPath(access.device.osType)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the schema** — in `apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemas.ts`, replace the `disk_cleanup` entry (`:998-1007`):

```ts
  disk_cleanup: z.object({
    deviceId: uuid,
    action: z.enum(['preview', 'execute']),
    // The volume to preview/clean. Normalised server-side; defaults to the
    // device's OS root. `safePath` (not `cleanupPath`) so the blocked-prefix
    // list applies — a scan ROOT is never /proc, /sys or /dev.
    path: safePath.optional(),
    categories: z.array(z.enum(['temp_files', 'browser_cache', 'package_cache', 'trash'])).max(10).optional(),
    paths: z.array(cleanupPath).min(1).max(200).optional(),
    maxCandidates: z.number().int().min(1).max(200).optional(),
  }).refine(
    (data) => data.action === 'preview' || (data.action === 'execute' && Array.isArray(data.paths) && data.paths.length > 0),
    { message: 'paths are required for execute action' }
  ),
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the handlers** — in `apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts`, add to the imports:

```ts
import { normalizeScanPath, osRootScanPath } from '@breeze/shared';
```

In `analyze_disk_usage`, replace the path derivation (`:158-162`):

```ts
      const osType = access.device.osType;
      const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(
        osType,
        typeof input.path === 'string' && input.path.length > 0 ? input.path : osRootScanPath(osType),
      );
      // Narrower than the route's check on purpose: the tool has no volume
      // list, so only the OS root auto-continues a checkpointed baseline. A
      // second volume's scan simply does not self-resume from the AI lane.
      const isRootScopedScan = scanPath === osRootScanPath(osType);

      let snapshot = await getLatestFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId, scanPath);
```

replace the dispatch `path` (`:170`) with `path: scanPath,`, replace the save (`:186`) with:

```ts
        snapshot = await saveFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId, access.device.orgId, 'on_demand', scanPath, parsed);
```

and add `scanPath` to the returned JSON, as the first key of the object at `:194`:

```ts
      return JSON.stringify({
        scanPath,
        snapshot: {
```

Also update the `path` property description in the tool definition (`:139`):

```ts
          path: { type: 'string', description: 'Volume or directory to analyse (e.g. "C:\\\\", "D:\\\\", "/", "/data"). Defaults to the OS root.' },
```

In `disk_cleanup`, add the `path` property to the definition (after `action`, `:237`):

```ts
          path: { type: 'string', description: 'Volume to preview or clean (e.g. "C:\\\\", "D:\\\\", "/", "/data"). Defaults to the OS root.' },
```

and in the handler, replace the snapshot read (`:266-269`):

```ts
      const osType = access.device.osType;
      const scanPath = normalizeScanPath(
        osType,
        typeof input.path === 'string' && input.path.length > 0 ? input.path : osRootScanPath(osType),
      );

      const snapshot = await getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot(deviceId, scanPath);
      if (!snapshot) {
        return JSON.stringify({
          scanPath,
          message: 'No filesystem analysis snapshot available for this volume. Run analyze_disk_usage with refresh=true first.',
        });
      }
```

In the preview lane, pin the volume on the run and echo it:

```ts
          .values({
            deviceId,
            orgId: access.device.orgId,
            // `?? scanPath`: the column is nullable in W02 (amendment 15) and
            // the row was SELECTed by `scanPath`, so the fallback is exact.
            scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
            requestedBy: safeRequestedBy,
            plan: {
              snapshotId: snapshot.id,
              scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
              categories: requestedCategories ?? safeCleanupCategories,
              preview,
            },
            status: 'previewed',
          })
```

```ts
        return JSON.stringify({
          cleanupRunId: cleanupRun?.id ?? null,
          scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
          snapshotId: snapshot.id,
```

and in the execute lane, the same two edits:

```ts
        .values({
          deviceId,
          orgId: access.device.orgId,
          scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
          requestedBy: safeRequestedBy,
          approvedAt: new Date(),
          plan: {
            snapshotId: snapshot.id,
            scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
            requestedPaths,
            selectedPaths: selected.map((candidate) => candidate.path),
          },
```

```ts
      return JSON.stringify({
        cleanupRunId: cleanupRun?.id ?? null,
        scanPath: snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath,
        snapshotId: snapshot.id,
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run \
  src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.scanPath.test.ts \
  src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.diskCleanupRequestedBy.test.ts \
  src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.fileWriteCap.test.ts \
  src/services/aiToolSchemas.validateToolInput.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  4 passed (4)`. Each path is listed in full — `src/services/aiToolsFilesystem` as a substring would also match unrelated files, and a trailing slash would match none of them. (There is no `aiToolSchemas.test.ts`; `aiToolSchemas.validateToolInput.test.ts` is the suite that drives `toolInputSchemas` end to end.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove no AI tool registry needed a change**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run \
  src/services/aiAgents/agentToolCatalog.contract.test.ts \
  src/services/aiGuardrails.agentPrincipal.contract.test.ts \
  src/services/helperToolFilter.test.ts \
  src/services/toolTimeouts.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  4 passed (4)` with no source edits. This task adds a property to two existing tools; it registers no tool, changes no tier and changes no rate limit, so every registry stays as it is. (W05 adds `system_cleanup`, which does touch all of them.)

- [ ] **Step 7: Typecheck and commit**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
git add apps/api/src/services/aiToolSchemas.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts apps/api/src/services/aiToolsFilesystem.scanPath.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(ai): analyze_disk_usage and disk_cleanup take a volume

Spec §9 (the path parameter only — tiers, registries and the system_cleanup
tool are W05). Both tools normalise the requested path server-side, read and
write per volume, pin it into the stored cleanup run, and echo scanPath so the
model can carry it between a preview and an execute.

disk_cleanup's Zod schema gains `path` (analyze_disk_usage's already had one).
No tool is registered and no tier or rate limit changes, so every tool registry
is untouched.

### Task 13: Web — `useFilesystemVolumes` and `VolumePicker`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.ts`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.test.tsx` (Test)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/VolumePicker.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/VolumePicker.test.tsx` (Test)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/locales/en/devices.json`, `de-DE`, `es-419`, `fr-FR`, `fr-CA`, `it-IT`, `pt-BR`, `tr-TR` (`deviceFilesystemTab` block)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fetchWithAuth` (`../../../stores/auth`), `useTranslation`, `formatNumber` (`@/lib/i18n/format`), `formatDateTime` (`@/lib/dateTimeFormat`).
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type FilesystemVolume = { mountPoint: string; scanPath: string; fsType: string | null;
    totalGb: number | null; usedGb: number | null; freeGb: number | null; usedPercent: number | null;
    isOsRoot: boolean;
    scanState: { lastRunMode: string; lastBaselineCompletedAt: string | null; hasCheckpoint: boolean } | null;
    latestSnapshot: { id: string; capturedAt: string; partial: boolean; cleanupEstimateBytes: number } | null; };
  export function useFilesystemVolumes(deviceId: string): { volumes: FilesystemVolume[]; loading: boolean; error?: string; reload: () => Promise<void> };
  export default function VolumePicker(props: { volumes: FilesystemVolume[]; selectedScanPath: string; onSelect: (scanPath: string) => void; loading: boolean; error?: string }): JSX.Element;
  ```

> **New code goes in `filesystem/`, not in the 958-line tab.** W03 splits the tab into that directory (spec §8); putting the hook and the picker there now means W03 inherits two finished files instead of having to extract them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the ten locale keys, translated, in all eight catalogs**

In each `apps/web/src/locales/<locale>/devices.json`, add these keys inside the existing `deviceFilesystemTab` object. `localeParity.test.ts` requires identical key sets and identical interpolation tokens across all eight, and refuses any value that looks like a bare filesystem path — which is why the mount point is interpolated rather than baked in.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run them and watch them fail**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.test.tsx src/components/devices/filesystem/VolumePicker.test.tsx
```

Expected failure: `Failed to resolve import "./useFilesystemVolumes"` and `"./VolumePicker"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the hook** — create `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.ts`:

```ts
import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

- [ ] **Step 6: Run them and watch them pass**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.test.tsx src/components/devices/filesystem/VolumePicker.test.tsx
```

Expected: `Test Files  2 passed (2)`, 11 tests passed.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the locale parity guard**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`. This is what proves all eight catalogs got the ten keys, that `{{used}}` / `{{total}}` / `{{when}}` / `{{mountPoint}}` survive every translation, and that none of the new values reads as a bare path.

- [ ] **Step 8: Astro check and commit**

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(web): volume picker and volumes hook for the Disk Cleanup tab

Spec §8. The hook owns an AbortController tied to unmount (defect 9's leak
starts by not repeating it) and carries `t` in its dependency list so a locale
switch does not leave an English fallback behind. The picker renders one chip
per volume with an OS badge, a usage bar, and last-scan age — and says
"Capacity unknown" rather than drawing a fake 0% bar for a volume the device
has reported no disk row for.

Ten new strings, really translated in all eight catalogs, with the mount point
interpolated so no locale value is a bare filesystem path.

Both live in components/devices/filesystem/ — the directory W03's tab split
moves into, so W03 inherits them finished. Nothing mounts them yet; Task 14.

### Task 14: MOUNT — wire the picker into `DeviceFilesystemTab` and re-key every panel

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx:1-16` (imports), `:228-231` (delete `getDefaultScanPath`), `:265-289` (state), `:290-322` (`fetchSnapshot`), `:324-350` (`loadAll`), `:410-464` (`runAnalyze`), `:466-496` (`runCleanupPreview`), `:543-553` (render the picker)
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.volumes.test.tsx` (Test)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `useFilesystemVolumes`, `VolumePicker` (Task 13); `osRootScanPath` (`@breeze/shared`).
- Produces: no new export. The tab renders `<VolumePicker>` and drives every fetch off `selectedScanPath`.

> **This task exists because components have shipped unmounted before** (memory: "Codex wave plans need an explicit MOUNT task: W05 built 13 green components and never wired the page"). The page-level test below fails if the picker is not rendered inside the tab, and fails if selecting a chip does not re-key the snapshot fetch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — create `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.volumes.test.tsx`:

```tsx
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.volumes.test.tsx
```

Expected failure: `Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="volume-picker"]` — the tab does not render it.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the mount** — in `apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx`:

Add to the imports:

```ts
import { osRootScanPath } from "@breeze/shared";
import VolumePicker from "./filesystem/VolumePicker";
import { useFilesystemVolumes } from "./filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes";
```

Delete `getDefaultScanPath` (`:228-231`) — `osRootScanPath` replaces it, and having two definitions of "the default volume" is how the web and the API drift apart.

Add `scanPath` to the `FilesystemSnapshot` type (`:32-69`), next to `path`:

```ts
  /** The normalised key this snapshot is stored under (W02). */
  scanPath?: string | null;
```

and to `FilesystemCleanupPreview` (`:71-81`):

```ts
  scanPath?: string | null;
```

Add the volume state, just under the `useTranslation` line (`:270`):

```ts
  const {
    volumes,
    loading: volumesLoading,
    error: volumesError,
    reload: reloadVolumes,
  } = useFilesystemVolumes(deviceId);
  // Seeded with the OS root so the first render already has a volume to read
  // — the tab must work even when the volumes call fails outright.
  const [selectedScanPath, setSelectedScanPath] = useState<string>(() => osRootScanPath(osType));

  // Correct the selection once the real list arrives: keep it if it is still
  // offered, otherwise fall back to the OS volume, otherwise the first chip.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (volumes.length === 0) return;
    if (volumes.some((volume) => volume.scanPath === selectedScanPath)) return;
    const osVolume = volumes.find((volume) => volume.isOsRoot) ?? volumes[0]!;
    setSelectedScanPath(osVolume.scanPath);
  }, [volumes, selectedScanPath]);
```

Re-key `fetchSnapshot` (`:290-305`):

```ts
  const fetchSnapshot = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await fetchWithAuth(
      `/devices/${deviceId}/filesystem?path=${encodeURIComponent(selectedScanPath)}`,
    );
    if (response.status === 404) {
      return null;
    }
    if (!response.ok) {
      const body = await response
        .json()
        .catch(() => ({
          error: t("deviceFilesystemTab.failedToFetchFilesystemStatus"),
        }));
      throw new Error(body.error || t("deviceFilesystemTab.failedToFetchFilesystemStatus"));
    }
    const body = await response.json();
    return (body.data ?? null) as FilesystemSnapshot | null;
  }, [deviceId, selectedScanPath, t]);
```

(`fetchThresholdEvents` and `pollScanCommand` gain `t` in their dependency lists for the same reason — defect 9's third bullet — and are otherwise unchanged.)

Clear the per-volume view when the selection changes, so a `D:\` preview can never render under a `C:\` chip. Add immediately after the correction effect:

```ts
  // Changing volume invalidates everything below the picker. `loadAll` is
  // already keyed on selectedScanPath through fetchSnapshot, so the fetch
  // re-runs on its own; this clears the STALE preview in the same tick rather
  // than leaving another volume's candidates on screen until it returns.
  useEffect(() => {
    setCleanupPreview(null);
    setSnapshot(null);
  }, [selectedScanPath]);
```

Point `runAnalyze`'s body at the selection (`:420-421`) — replace `path: getDefaultScanPath(osType),` with `path: selectedScanPath,` — and change its dependency list to `[deviceId, loadAll, selectedScanPath, pollScanCommand, reloadVolumes, t]`, adding a volumes refresh after a successful scan so the chip's "scanned" age updates:

```ts
      setCleanupPreview(null);
      await Promise.all([loadAll(true), reloadVolumes()]);
      setScanCommand(null);
```

Point `runCleanupPreview`'s body at the selection (`:474`) — replace `body: JSON.stringify({}),` with `body: JSON.stringify({ path: selectedScanPath }),` — and change its dependency list to `[deviceId, selectedScanPath, t]`.

Render the picker. Inside the header card, immediately after the closing `</div>` of the title/actions row (`:604`) and before the `{error && …}` block:

```tsx
        <div className="mt-4">
          <VolumePicker
            volumes={volumes}
            selectedScanPath={selectedScanPath}
            onSelect={setSelectedScanPath}
            loading={volumesLoading}
            error={volumesError}
          />
        </div>
```

Finally give the two action buttons stable test ids — on the Analyze button (`:554-566`) add `data-testid="filesystem-analyze"`, and on the Cleanup Preview button (`:567-579`) add `data-testid="filesystem-cleanup-preview"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.volumes.test.tsx
```

Expected: `Test Files  1 passed (1)`, 6 tests passed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Prove the tab still belongs on the runAction allowlist and nothing else regressed**

```bash
cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/no-silent-mutations.test.ts src/lib/i18n/localeParity.test.ts
```

Expected: `Test Files  2 passed (2)`. This wave adds no mutation, so `apps/web/src/lib/runActionAllowlist.ts:17` stays exactly as it is (amendment 14); W03 is the wave that removes it.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the old default-path helper is gone**

```bash
git grep -n 'getDefaultScanPath' -- apps/web
```

Expected: **no output.**

- [ ] **Step 7: Astro check and commit**

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm exec astro check
git add apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx apps/web/src/components/devices/DeviceFilesystemTab.volumes.test.tsx
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(web): mount the volume picker in the Disk Cleanup tab

Spec §8. The picker renders above the scan controls and every panel below it
re-keys on the selection: the snapshot read, the scan POST and the cleanup
preview all carry the selected scan path, and switching volume clears the stale
preview in the same tick rather than leaving another volume's candidates on
screen.

Seeded with the OS root so the tab still works when the volumes call fails, and
corrected once the real list arrives. getDefaultScanPath is deleted —
osRootScanPath is the one definition, shared with the API.

The page-level test is the point: it fails if the picker is not rendered inside
the tab, and it fails if selecting a chip does not re-key the fetches.

### Task 15: Docs — the volumes half of `filesystem-analysis.mdx`

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/filesystem-analysis.mdx` (a new `### Volumes` section under "Deep Filesystem Scan"; the three Database Schema tables at `:434-491`; the API Reference table at `:496-504`)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/data/docsIndex.json` (regenerated)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: docs only. §11's remaining docs work — the finished tab, the native catalog, `agents/commands.mdx`, `features/ai.mdx`, `features/mcp-server.mdx`, `features/playbooks.mdx` — belongs to W05.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing check** — the docs contract this wave can fail is the index: `docsIndex.json` records every heading, so adding one without regenerating leaves the AI docs tool blind to it. Capture the current state first:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
entries = json.load(open('apps/api/src/data/docsIndex.json'))
entry = next(e for e in entries if e['path'] == '/features/filesystem-analysis/')
print('Volumes' in entry['headings'])
"
```

Expected: `False`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement the docs** — in `apps/docs/src/content/docs/features/filesystem-analysis.mdx`, insert this section immediately after the "How Scanning Works" paragraphs and before `### Scan Strategies` (`:39`):

(Four backticks on the outer fence below because the block itself contains a fenced JSON sample — copy the inner three-backtick fences into the `.mdx` verbatim, and drop the four-backtick wrapper.)

````mdx
### Volumes

A scan targets one **volume** at a time. `GET /devices/:id/filesystem/volumes` lists the volumes a device can scan, derived from its reported disk inventory:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "mountPoint": "C:\\",
      "scanPath": "C:\\",
      "fsType": "NTFS",
      "totalGb": 476.9,
      "usedGb": 401.2,
      "freeGb": 75.7,
      "usedPercent": 84.1,
      "isOsRoot": true,
      "scanState": {
        "lastRunMode": "incremental",
        "lastBaselineCompletedAt": "2026-10-18T02:14:00.000Z",
        "hasCheckpoint": false
      },
      "latestSnapshot": {
        "id": "8f2b...",
        "capturedAt": "2026-10-20T09:31:00.000Z",
        "partial": false,
        "cleanupEstimateBytes": 12884901888
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Volumes that cannot be cleaned are not offered: read-only media (`cdfs`, `udf`, `iso9660`, `squashfs`), memory filesystems (`tmpfs`, `devtmpfs`), kernel filesystems (`proc`, `sysfs`), and container or network mounts (`overlay`, `nfs`, `nfs4`, `cifs`, `smbfs`, `9p`, `autofs`, and every `fuse*` variant), along with Windows UNC paths. Deleting through a network mount frees space on a machine that is not the one being cleaned.

The device's OS volume is always listed, even on a device that has not yet reported a disk inventory, so a fresh endpoint can still be scanned. When no disk row backs it, its capacity fields are `null` rather than `0`.

<Aside type="caution">
  **Every volume keeps its own state.** Scan checkpoints, the incremental baseline, the hot-directory list and the "latest snapshot" a cleanup preview reads are all keyed on `(device, volume)`. A scan of `D:\` neither resets nor is read by anything belonging to `C:\`.
</Aside>

#### Scan paths are normalised

The volume key is a normalised path, and it is what `scan_path` stores, what `?path=` expects and what the agent receives:

- **Windows** -- separators become `\`, repeats collapse, the drive letter is upper-cased, and a trailing `\` survives only on a volume root. `c:/Users//Todd/` and `C:\Users\Todd` are the same volume path; `c:\`, `C:/` and `C:` are all `C:\`.
- **macOS and Linux** -- repeats collapse, `.` and `..` resolve, and a trailing `/` survives only on `/` itself. Case is preserved: `/Users` and `/users` are different directories on a case-sensitive volume.

Requests may send any of these forms. The API normalises before reading or writing, so you never have to.
````

Replace the three Database Schema tables' rows (`:434-491`) so each records the new columns. In **Filesystem Snapshots**, add after the `device_id` row:

```mdx
| `scan_path` | text | The normalised volume/path this scan covered. One snapshot stream per volume. |
```

and replace the index line beneath the table:

```mdx
Indexed on `(device_id, scan_path, captured_at DESC)` for efficient latest-snapshot-per-volume queries.
```

In **Cleanup Runs**, add after the `device_id` row:

```mdx
| `scan_path` | text | The volume this run covers. Null for a system-cleanup run, which cleans the machine rather than a path. |
| `kind` | text | `files` (the itemized file engine) or `system` (OS-native cleaners). |
| `command_id` | UUID | The queued system-cleanup command, for `kind = 'system'` runs. |
```

and change the `status` row to:

```mdx
| `status` | enum | `previewed`, `running`, `executed`, or `failed`. |
```

In **Scan State**, replace the `device_id` row and add `scan_path`:

```mdx
| `device_id` | UUID | Foreign key to `devices`. First half of the primary key. |
| `scan_path` | text | The normalised volume. Second half of the primary key -- one checkpoint and baseline per volume. |
```

In the **API Reference** table (`:500-504`), add the volumes endpoint and note the query parameter:

```mdx
| `GET` | `/devices/:id/filesystem/volumes` | List the volumes this device can scan and clean | `devices.read` |
| `GET` | `/devices/:id/filesystem?path=` | Get the latest snapshot for a volume (defaults to the OS volume) | `devices.read` |
```

replacing the existing `GET /devices/:id/filesystem` row, and add a line under the table:

```mdx
`POST /devices/:id/filesystem/scan` and `POST /devices/:id/filesystem/cleanup-preview` both accept a `path` naming the volume; both default to the device's OS volume. Every response that concerns one volume echoes the normalised `scanPath` it used.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Regenerate the docs index**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/build-docs-index.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it pass**

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
entries = json.load(open('apps/api/src/data/docsIndex.json'))
entry = next(e for e in entries if e['path'] == '/features/filesystem-analysis/')
assert 'Volumes' in entry['headings'], entry['headings']
assert 'Scan paths are normalised' in entry['headings'], entry['headings']
print('ok')
"
```

Expected: `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the docs checks CI runs**

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs check
pnpm --filter @breeze/docs build
pnpm test:docs-automation
bash scripts/security/check-customer-pii.sh
```

Expected: all four clean. The PII guard runs here because a docs-only change skips `security-audit` and #6187 shipped example addresses that later reddened every code PR on main.

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(filesystem): volumes, normalised scan paths, and the new columns

Spec §11. Documents the volumes endpoint and its response, which filesystem
types are never offered and why, that the OS volume is always listed, and the
per-OS normalisation rules callers do not have to apply themselves. Records
scan_path on all three tables, kind/command_id and the `running` status on
cleanup runs, the composite scan-state key, and the ?path= parameter.

docsIndex.json regenerated so the AI docs tool can see the new headings.

The finished tab, the native cleaner catalog and the AI/playbook/command pages
are W05's docs pass.

### Task 16: The verification gate

**Files:** none. Nothing is edited here; this is the run that decides the PR is real.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rebase onto current main and re-run the migration naming guard**

```bash
git fetch origin main --quiet
git merge origin/main --no-edit
bash scripts/check-migration-naming.sh --against-ref origin/main
```

Expected: clean merge, guard exits 0. **Local green is not CI green** — a branch cut before a migration landed on main passes the commit-time guard and fails at push. If the guard now reports that either file no longer sorts last, rename BOTH, sweep every reference (`git grep -n '2026-10-20-1500' -- apps`), and record it as an amendment.

- [ ] **Step 2: Typecheck everything the Type Check job checks**

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project apps/api/tsconfig.json
pnpm --filter @breeze/shared typecheck
cd apps/web && pnpm exec astro check
```

Expected: all three clean.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the full shared, API and web unit suites**

```bash
cd packages/shared && npx vitest run
cd apps/api && npx vitest run
cd apps/web && npx vitest run
```

Expected: all green. The API run is the only thing that catches a mock factory elsewhere in the repo whose `saveFilesystemSnapshot` or `getFilesystemScanState` stub asserts the old arity — `git grep` found eight `helpers.*.test.ts` files that stub those functions, and a stub with no assertion on its arguments passes either way, so the compiler plus this run is the real coverage.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run every contract suite this wave can break**

```bash
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/filesystemMultiVolumeMigration.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenant-export-policy.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantExportErasureRoundtrip.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/tenantCascade.integration.test.ts \
  src/__tests__/integration/orgLifecycleFoundations.integration.test.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.rls-coverage.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.site-scope-coverage.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run --config vitest.config.integration-suite-coverage.ts
cd apps/api && npx vitest run src/db/migrationRlsScope.test.ts src/db/autoMigrate.test.ts
```

Expected: every one green. `pnpm test` does NOT run the RLS or integration configs, so skipping this step is how a unit-green PR reddens main. Needs a live database: `pnpm test-stack up` first.

- [ ] **Step 5: Drift check**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="$(grep -E '^DATABASE_URL=' .env.test | cut -d= -f2-)" pnpm db:check-drift
```

Expected: one ledger row per migration file, no ordering or idempotency error.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the registration lists are exactly as this plan claims (amendment 11)**

```bash
git grep -n 'device_filesystem' -- apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts
git grep -n 'device_filesystem' -- apps/api/src/services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts apps/api/src/__tests__/integration/rls-coverage.integration.test.ts
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD -- apps/api/src/services/tenantCascade.ts apps/api/src/routes/devices/core.ts apps/api/src/services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts
```

Expected: the first grep lists the three tables in all three device/org cascade lists; the second returns **nothing**; the third returns **no output** — this wave changes no cascade list, which is a claim the diff has to back.

- [ ] **Step 7: Prove this wave contracted nothing (amendments 15–16)**

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- apps/api/migrations | grep -nE '^\+.*(SET NOT NULL|ADD PRIMARY KEY|PRIMARY KEY \()'
git grep -n "notNull()" -- apps/api/src/db/schema/filesystem.ts | grep scan_path
```

Expected: **no output from either.** Both `scan_path` columns are nullable and there is no primary key on `device_filesystem_scan_state` until W03's contract migration. A hit here means an old replica loses a snapshot the moment this deploys.

```bash
git grep -n 'device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx' -- apps/api
```

Expected: the migration, the Drizzle mirror and the replay suite — three files. W03's plan must name this index; if its plan does not, say so in the PR before merging.

- [ ] **Step 8: Prove the scan-path sweep is complete**

```bash
git grep -n "=== 'C:\\\\\\\\'\|'C:\\\\\\\\'" -- apps/api/src apps/web/src | grep -v test | grep -v scanPath.ts
```

Expected: no hard-coded OS root outside `packages/shared/src/utils/scanPath.ts` and test fixtures. Every other site goes through `osRootScanPath`.

```bash
git grep -n 'deviceFilesystemSnapshots\.\|deviceFilesystemScanState\.' -- apps ee packages | grep -v '\.test\.' | grep -v 'db/schema'
```

Expected: matches only inside `apps/api/src/services/filesystemAnalysis.ts` and `apps/api/src/routes/agents/helpers.ts` (the threshold cooldown read). Any other file touching those tables directly would be a reader that bypasses the scan-path key.

- [ ] **Step 9: Lint**

```bash
pnpm --filter @breeze/api lint
pnpm --filter @breeze/web lint
```

Expected: clean.

- [ ] **Step 10: Tear down the local stack**

```bash
pnpm test-stack down
docker compose ls -a --format json | jq -r '.[] | select(.ConfigFiles|test("breeze")) | "\(.Name)\t\(.Status)"'
```

Expected: the second command lists nothing this session brought up. Nothing reaps a local stack for you.

- [ ] **Step 11: Open the PR**

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "Disk Cleanup v2 W02: multi-volume filesystem analysis" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Closes #<subissue#>

## What

Gives filesystem analysis a scan-path axis. A `D:\` or `/data` scan no longer
resets the `C:\` baseline, pollutes its hot-directory list, or becomes the
"latest" snapshot a `C:\` cleanup preview deletes from (spec §2 defect 6), and
the incremental-vs-baseline decision compares a volume against its own recorded
usage instead of the fullest disk on the device (defect 8).

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-19-disk-cleanup-v2-design.md` §4, §5.1,
§5.2 (pinning only), §8 (picker + mount), §9 (`path` only), §11.

## Schema and code ship together

`upsertFilesystemScanState`'s `ON CONFLICT` target moves with the key. Once the
single-column key is dropped a `target: deviceId` names no unique index and
raises `42P10`, so this cannot be split into a schema PR and a code PR.

## Expand only — W03 owes the contract migration

Per the Codex quorum finding in spec §13 #7, this wave adds **no** `NOT NULL`
and **no** primary key. `scan_path` is nullable on both tables and the
scan-state key is a nullable-tolerant `UNIQUE INDEX`
(`device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`).

**W03 must ship `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql`:**
`SET NOT NULL` on both `scan_path` columns, then
`ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX
device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`. It runs only once W02 is
deployed everywhere.

Rolling-deploy behaviour, precisely: old replicas' snapshot INSERTs keep
working (the column is nullable, and every reader falls back to the key it
queried by); their scan-state UPSERTs fail with `42P10` from the moment the
single-column key is dropped until they drain, and a re-run scan repairs that
state. Release-notes item.

## Migrations

- `2026-10-21-110000-filesystem-multi-volume.sql` — nullable `scan_path` on all
  three tables, `scan_generation` on scan state, the `(device_id, scan_path)`
  unique index, the swapped snapshot index, `kind` + `command_id` on cleanup
  runs. Both backfills elect `breeze.scope = 'system'`, share one
  migration-local normalisation helper, and report their counts.
- `2026-10-21-110100-filesystem-cleanup-run-status-running.sql` — the enum add,
  alone in its file.

The scan-state backfill runs in two passes (§13 #8): a legacy row keeps its
checkpoint only when the device's newest snapshot names a volume the device
still reports; otherwise the row is labelled the OS root and its
`checkpoint`/`aggregate`/`hot_directories` are cleared, because resuming a
`D:\` checkpoint into `C:\` would reintroduce defect 6.

## Concurrency

`device_filesystem_scan_state.scan_generation` (§13 #18) records the command id
owning each volume's current run. The result handler claims it with one
conditional UPDATE, which makes result application exclusive (a superseded scan
cannot overwrite a newer checkpoint) and idempotent (a duplicate delivery is
dropped). The continuation-suppression probe, which matched any in-flight scan
on the DEVICE and so let a `C:\` scan cancel a `D:\` auto-resume, is now
scoped to the same path.

## Registration lists

`CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` gains six columns, all `included` — the one list
that fires on a new COLUMN. Every cascade list is verified unchanged and the
diff shows no edit to any of them: all three tables were already registered,
none carries a `ticket_id`, none is append-only, and all three are tenancy
shape 1 so no RLS allowlist applies.

## Agent

No agent change and no agent release. Old agents keep working: the API sends
the normalised path in the command payload and keys the result on it.

- [ ] **Step 12: Watch CI and report**

```bash
gh pr checks --watch
```

Expected: `CI Success` green. `gh pr checks` exits non-zero while checks are pending, so read the output rather than the exit code. If **Integration Tests** is red on a shard this wave does not obviously touch, check the shard's `tenant-export-policy` and `tenantCascade` cases first — those are the two that fire on a new column and the two that a unit-green PR misses.

**Owed to W03 by this wave** (state it in the W03 plan, not just here): `2026-10-20-15xx00-filesystem-scan-path-not-null.sql` — `SET NOT NULL` on `device_filesystem_snapshots.scan_path` and `device_filesystem_scan_state.scan_path`, then `ADD CONSTRAINT device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX device_filesystem_scan_state_device_path_uidx`; the matching Drizzle flip (`.notNull()` on both columns, `uniqueIndex` → `primaryKey({ name: 'device_filesystem_scan_state_pkey', … })`); dropping the `?? scanPath` fallbacks in `routes/devices/filesystem.ts` and `services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts`; and flipping Task 5's "leaves BOTH scan_path columns nullable" assertion to `NO`.

**Deliberately NOT in this wave** (and where each lives): the `contentsOnly`/`permanent`/`cleanupGuard` dispatch payload, the rooted rule table, the per-volume recycle bin and the accumulator fixes → W01. Required `cleanupRunId`, `rejectedPaths`, the execute budget, the tab split and its finished panels, run history and retention, and removing `DeviceFilesystemTab.tsx` from `runActionAllowlist.ts` → W03. The native cleaner catalog and both `system_cleanup` command types → W04. The `system_cleanup` AI tool, every tier/registry/label/timeout entry, `actRevalidation`/`actVerify`, the built-in playbook, the lab proof and the remaining five docs pages → W05.

### Placeholder scan

`grep -nE 'TBD|TODO|FIXME|similar to Task|handle edge cases|add validation'` over this document returns exactly two lines, both in this section's own quoting of the pattern and in the frontmatter:
- `tracking_issue: LanternOps/breeze#6326`, which the plan contract requires verbatim until registration;
- this paragraph.

Also present and deliberate: `<parent#>` / `<subissue#>` in the **Branch** line, the PR body's `Closes`, and the Global Constraints — the one placeholder pair the contract allows. `amendment 15` in amendment 13 and Task 16 Step 1 is an instruction to ADD an amendment if the migration names stop sorting last, not an unfilled slot.

Amendments now run 1–18; 15–18 carry the Codex quorum findings from spec §13 (#7, #8, #18 and the adjacent continuation-suppression defect), and the forward references in amendment 13 and Task 16 Step 1 point at amendment 19. Every code step carries a complete code block. No step says "similar to" another; the repeated fragments (the device-access preamble, the `values({...})` shapes) are written out in full each time.

### Type-consistency check

- `FilesystemVolume` is declared twice on purpose — `apps/api/src/services/filesystemVolumes.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/devices/filesystem/useFilesystemVolumes.ts` — with identical field names and nullability (`totalGb`/`usedGb`/`freeGb`/`usedPercent` are `number | null` on both sides). The web copy carries a comment naming the API type as its source. They are not shared through `@breeze/shared` because the web copy is a wire-shape mirror, not a contract the API imports; W03's tab split is the place to revisit that if a third consumer appears.
- `normalizeScanPath(osType: unknown, path: string)` takes `unknown` for the OS so every caller can pass `device.osType` (`'windows' | 'macos' | 'linux'`), `(device as { osType?: unknown }).osType` (the route's loosely-typed device), or `deviceRow.osType` without a cast. `ScanPathOsType` is exported for callers that want the narrow type.
- `saveFilesystemSnapshot(deviceId, orgId, trigger, scanPath, payload)` — `scanPath` at index 3, all scalars before the blob. The two positional destructures in `agents.test.ts` are updated in the same task (amendment 7).
- `getLatestFilesystemCleanupSnapshot` now projects `{ id, scanPath, capturedAt, partial, cleanupCandidates }`. `buildCleanupPreview(snapshot)` needs only `{ id, cleanupCandidates }`, so the widened projection satisfies it structurally with no signature change.
- Both `scanPath` columns are `text | null` in W02 (amendment 15), so `snapshot.scanPath` is `string | null`. Every read site uses `snapshot.scanPath ?? scanPath` — exact rather than a guess, because the row was SELECTed by that key — and W03's contract migration removes the need for it. `deviceFilesystemScanState.scanPath` is never read off a row in this wave, only queried by.
- `scanGeneration` is `string | null` and is deliberately absent from `upsertFilesystemScanState`'s `updates` type: it is owned by `setFilesystemScanGeneration` and `claimFilesystemScanGeneration`, so the handler's final upsert cannot resurrect a generation it just claimed.
- `ScanGenerationClaim` is a four-member string union; the handler branches on two of them (`superseded`, `already_applied`) and falls through on the other two, so adding a fifth member would not silently change behaviour but also would not be caught by the compiler — the four cases are pinned by tests in Tasks 6 and 11 instead.
- `filesystemCleanupRunStatusEnum.enumValues` widens from three literals to four. Verified no exhaustive switch exists over it: the only consumers are `routes/devices/filesystem.ts:303`, `services/aiToolsFilesystem.ts:290` and `services/aiAgents/actRevalidation.ts:148`, each comparing against a single literal.
- `deviceFilesystemScanState.deviceId` changes from `.primaryKey()` to `.notNull()`; both produce a non-nullable `string` in `$inferSelect`, so no consumer's type changes. The table now declares a `uniqueIndex` and no `primaryKey`, which Drizzle permits; `onConflictDoUpdate({ target: [deviceId, scanPath] })` emits the same `ON CONFLICT (device_id, scan_path)` either way, and Postgres infers a plain unique index exactly as it would a constraint (pinned by a live test in Task 5).

### Open questions for the reviewer

None blocking. One judgement call worth a second opinion: Task 7 issues two queries per volume (capped at 24) rather than one `DISTINCT ON` over all volumes. The Drizzle-native form is far easier to mock and to read, a real endpoint has one to four fixed volumes, and the cap bounds the pathological case — but if a Linux fleet with large mount tables makes `GET /filesystem/volumes` slow in practice, the fix is a single windowed query in `filesystemVolumes.ts` and nothing else moves.
