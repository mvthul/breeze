# Alerting consolidation

## Problem

This is the third pass at the same complaint. The 2026-07-30 plan moved server-evaluated
rules out of the config-policy Monitoring tab into an Alerts tab. The 2026-09-08 spec built the
Monitor object the community asked for (condition + response + delivery + escalate-to-human)
and shipped it in four waves. Neither pass retired anything. The 09-08 spec listed retirement as
"W5, a separate program", and that program was never written. Then #5710 moved the Monitors
page under Alerts, where it now sits as a fourth peer tab next to the surfaces it was built to
replace.

Verified on `main` at `b8dd148bd8` (2026-09-19):

- **13 places author an alert condition**, writing 6 tables, across the Alerts hub (Monitors,
  Rules, Channels), Settings (Alert Templates), the config-policy editor (Alerts, Monitors,
  Service & Process Monitoring, Automations, Warranty, Event Logs), Jobs (event rules), and the
  Network Monitor page.
- **Two independent sweeps run every cycle** — `evaluateDeviceAlerts` over `alert_rules` and
  `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy` over `config_policy_alert_rules`
  (`apps/api/src/jobs/alertWorker.ts:257,261`). A policy holding a hand-written "CPU > 80" inline
  rule *and* the attached built-in "High CPU usage" monitor raises two alerts for one condition.
  No screen warns about it.
- **Alert Templates authored in `/settings/alert-templates` can never fire.** The editor stores
  `conditions = {triggers, thresholdDefaults, notifications, escalationRules, autoRemediation,
  suppression}`; the evaluator sees neither an array nor a `{logic, conditions}` group and
  rejects it as `Unknown condition type: undefined`
  (`apps/api/src/services/alertConditions/index.ts:91-93`, `registry.ts:36-42`). `targets` is
  read by nothing at runtime.
- **Delivery is decided in five places with a hidden precedence.** Monitor override → inline
  rule's channel list → first matching routing rule (severity and site only; the
  `conditionTypes` and `deviceTags` fields are accepted by the API and never evaluated,
  `notificationDispatcher.ts:1272-1291`) → **every enabled channel in the org plus every
  partner-wide channel** (`:359-375`). Channels have no severity filter. Escalation policies run
  only when a rule names one, and there is no UI to create one.
- **Copy lies.** The monitor editor still says a service watch "must also exist in the policy's
  Service & Process Monitoring tab until that is unified" (`monitoring.json`
  `editor.agentDeliveredHint`); W04 unified it. The promised "points at Monitors" banners on the
  legacy tabs were never built.
- **Conversion only exists for standalone rules.** `POST /monitor-definitions/convert-from-rule`
  handles `alert_rules` rows; the inline policy rules in the owner's screenshot have no path to
  Monitors at all, and multi-condition rules cannot convert (`monitorConversion.ts:50-57`).

Three further defects surfaced during the design review of this spec (Codex xhigh, verified in
code 2026-09-19) and are filed as #6342, #6343, #6344; they are prerequisites, not part of the program:

- **Monitors of kind `offline` have no firing path.** The sweep selects online devices only
  (`alertWorker.ts:196-199`), and the offline-transition path queries `alert_rules` with
  `targetType IN (all, org, site, device)` — never `monitor` (`offlineAlertEffects.ts:31-37`).
- **A monitor's `restart_service` response never reaches the agent.** Saving a monitor normalizes
  `execute_command` actions down to `{type, command, shell}` (`automationRuntime.ts:671-680`),
  dropping the `kind` discriminator the watch builder requires (`routes/agents/helpers.ts:2152`).
- **The monitor resolver ignores assignment `roleFilter` / `osFilter`** (`monitorResolver.ts` has
  no reference to either; `configurationPolicy.ts:2434` applies both for every other feature).

The community proposal was right about the object and right about the problem. What it
described — one place to say *what to watch, what to run, who to tell, when to involve a human*
— is exactly what has not happened at the screen level.

## The conceptual correction

Monitoring software (Datadog, Grafana, Zabbix) is built around the data; alerting is a layer on
top. An RMM is the reverse: nobody opens Breeze to watch a CPU graph. A monitor exists to produce
an alert, an alert exists to make a technician act or to trigger an auto-fix. The 09-08 spec's
decision D1 ("Alerts stays the inbox; Monitoring is a separate domain") imported the
monitoring-software framing. That is the misalignment. This spec replaces it:

> **Alerting is one domain with three facets.** *Monitors* say what we watch for and what happens
> when it fires. The *Inbox* shows what is wrong now. *Delivery* says who gets told and how.
> Config policies answer one question only: *which devices does a monitor apply to.*
> "Monitoring" as a word means seeing data, and it lives where the data is: the device page and
> the Network page.

Two invariants every wave must preserve:

1. **Every condition-based device alert traces to exactly one monitor.** Metric, state, event
   log, service, process, script and network-check conditions have one authoring object, one
   evaluation path, one row. *Sourced* alerts raised by a feature's own engine (compliance
   bridge, warranty, patch jobs, security, backup) keep their producers; those are feature
   settings, not condition rules, and are out of scope.
2. **Every notification traces to one delivery decision a technician can read on screen.** No
   emergent fallback; the default is a row you can edit.

## Goals

1. One authoring surface for alert conditions: **Monitors**. Every legacy surface is converted
   and removed, not hidden.
2. One delivery model with a visible default and one precedence, used identically by the
   dispatcher and by the monitor editor's preview.
3. Zero double-evaluation: one sweep path once conversion completes.
4. Nothing a customer configured stops working silently. Everything that cannot be converted is
   listed for a human.
5. Config-policy editor shows one tab for the whole topic.

## Non-goals

- New agent collectors (WMI, perf counters, file size, sensors) — still separate agent specs.
- Ticket as a delivery channel (#5238).
- Incidents (`/incidents`) — a separate incident-response object with its own lifecycle; not an
  alert-authoring surface and untouched here.
- Network SNMP template authoring and the discovery engine. Only network **check** authoring
  moves (W05e).
- Dropping `alert_rules` / `alert_templates` tables: compiled monitors fire *through* them
  (`monitorCompiler.ts:130-182`). Only unmanaged rows and their editors go.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Chosen | Supersedes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Domain model | **Alerts is one nav entry with three facets: Inbox, Monitors, Delivery.** No "Monitoring" nav entry for authoring. | 09-08 D1 |
| C2 | Name of the rule object | **Monitor.** Industry word, four shipped waves, docs and MCP tools already use it. Under Alerts it reads "the monitors that produce these alerts". | — |
| C3 | Legacy surfaces | **Retired, not thin pointers.** Policy Alerts tab, policy Service & Process Monitoring tab, `/alerts/rules`, `/settings/alert-templates`, unmanaged `alert_rules`/`alert_templates` writes, `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy`. Retirement is gated on conversion, never on a date alone. | 09-08 Non-goals |
| C4 | Conversion | **Assisted, previewed, per policy, with a system-run sweep at the end.** Not silent at deploy. Every converted source row is retired in place (`retired_at`, `converted_to_monitor_id`) so alert history keeps its FK; nothing is deleted. | 09-08 "explicit and per rule" |
| C5 | Delivery default | **An explicit "Everything else" routing row per partner and (optionally) per org replaces the all-channels fallback.** Migration writes it from the current effective set, so day-one behavior is identical; from then on a new channel is opt-in. | — |
| C6 | Escalation | **A property of delivery.** Routing rows and monitors may name an escalation policy; escalation policies get CRUD on the Delivery page. | — |
| C7 | Cross-cutting reactive workflows ("any critical alert → AI triage") | **Stay under Jobs as event-triggered automations**, with a typed filter (severities, monitor kinds) the UI can author. Per-monitor responses live on the monitor and are device-bound. Distinct semantics, distinct name. | — |
| C8 | Multi-condition rules | **New `composite` monitor kind** (`all: [{kind, condition}]`) compiling to an `{logic:'and'}` group. No OR (no write path produces one today). | — |
| C9 | Agent-side watch settings | **Restart parameters move to the `restart_service` response action; the per-policy check interval stays a per-policy setting on the Monitors tab.** `alertOnStop` and `alertSeverity` on watches are dropped (stored, never read: `aiToolsConfigPolicy.ts:880`). | — |
| C10 | Network checks | **Become monitors of kind `network_check` in the final wave.** The Network page keeps assets, SNMP templates and results. | — |
| C11 | Delivery review, 2026-09-19 | **D22–D26 align delivery with PRs #6385/#6387:** legacy escalation precedes routing during transition; bounded steps; removable org default; caller-scoped user targets (product owner confirmation pending); dispatch observability. | Brief escalation order; D18 default-row permanence on the org axis |

## Prerequisite defects (must land before W05c)

| Issue | Defect | Why it gates conversion |
|---|---|---|
| #6342 | `offlineAlertEffects` must resolve monitors for the device (via `resolveMonitorsForDevice`) alongside legacy rules, honouring per-monitor duration | converting an inline "Device offline" rule would silently stop it firing |
| #6343 | `normalizeActions` keeps `kind`, `maxAttempts`, `cooldownSeconds` on `execute_command`; the watch builder reads them | converting a watch with `autoRestart` would silently lose the restart |
| #6344 | `resolveMonitorsForDevice` applies assignment `roleFilter`/`osFilter` exactly as `resolveEffectiveConfigWithExecutor` does | converting a policy assigned "servers only" would widen it to every device |

Each is a single-PR fix with an integration test, filed and fixed independently of this program.

Two more, found while planning W05e and gating **that** wave only: #6352 (`network_check` monitors
write `config.expectStatus`; the agent reads `expectedStatus`, so HTTP checks always expect 200)
and #6353 (the `network_check` handler breaches for every device the policy reaches, so one failing
check raises one alert per online device; the legacy worker picks a single alert device).

## End state

### Navigation

Left nav is unchanged in shape. **Alerts** (bell) is the domain. **Incidents**, **Approvals**
stay as they are. **Network Monitor** is renamed **Network** in W05e once it no longer authors
alerts.

Alerts hub tab strip (`AlertsTabStrip.tsx`):

| Tab | Route | Facet |
|---|---|---|
| Alerts | `/alerts` | Inbox |
| Correlations | `/alerts/correlations` | Inbox (flag-gated as today) |
| Monitors | `/alerts/monitors` | Monitors |
| Delivery | `/alerts/delivery` | Delivery |

Removed: **Rules** (after W05d), **Channels** (folded into Delivery, `/alerts/channels` → 301).

### Monitors (library)

`/alerts/monitors` — unchanged W02 list (name, kind, severity, deployed-to, owner, enabled) with:

- **New monitor** and, when the partner's built-ins are unattached anywhere, a **Recommended**
  strip: "Attach the four built-in monitors to a policy" → picker. (Built-ins stay unattached by
  default per the 09-13 decision; the strip makes that a choice instead of a silence.)
- During W05c only: a **Needs conversion** filter and banner ("12 legacy rules across 3 policies
  have not been converted") linking to the per-policy conversion panel. Gone in W05d.

Monitor editor cards keep the W02 order: What to watch · Severity & noise · Respond · Notify ·
Escalate to a human · Deployed to · Activity. Changes:

- **Notify** defaults to *Inherit* and renders the **resolved** answer from the same resolver the
  dispatcher uses: "Critical → PagerDuty (partner rule 'Pages'), escalates via *On-call*". The
  override is one choice: *use these channels instead* (with optional escalation policy) or
  *inbox only*. Settings rule 4: blank = inherit, and the field shows the inherited value and
  where it comes from.
- **Respond** — the `execute_command` action with `kind: 'restart_service'` gains
  `maxAttempts` (0–50, default 3) and `cooldownSeconds` (30–86400, default 300). These are the
  watch's `maxRestartAttempts`/`restartCooldownSeconds` moved to where the restart is authored.
- **What to watch** — new kind **Composite** ("all of the following"): a list of child
  conditions, each a kind picker plus that kind's fields. Max 10 children, no nesting.
- The false `agentDeliveredHint` is deleted (W05a). Service and process monitors show "Runs on
  the device" with no cross-reference, because there is nothing to cross-reference.

### Delivery

`/alerts/delivery` — one page, three sections, one save pattern each (lists → row drawer):

1. **Channels** — the existing channel cards (email, Slack, Teams, webhook, PagerDuty, SMS,
   Pushover), owner badge, test, throttle.
2. **Routing** — an ordered list. Each row: *match* (severities; monitor kinds; sites), *send
   to* (channels), *escalate via* (escalation policy, optional). The list always ends with the
   partner's **Everything else** row, which cannot be deleted or reordered, and whose channels
   can be emptied to stop channel delivery (escalation still applies). A partner sees the
   partner-wide list; an org sees its own rows above the partner's, with the partner rows
   read-only and labelled, and its own optional Everything-else row that, when present,
   shadows the partner's for that org. **Use partner default** removes an editable org override
   after confirming the partner channels and escalation it will inherit, or inbox only if
   neither is configured. **Customize for this organization** explains that the override stops
   following the partner default and can be removed later. The page prints
   the precedence in one line: *A monitor's own Notify setting wins; otherwise the first matching
   row from the top.*
3. **Escalation policies** — CRUD over `escalation_policies`, owner badge. At most 10 steps;
   each delays at least 1 whole minute and targets at least one channel or user. Repeats run
   every 1–1440 whole minutes, for 1–10 additional sends; the policy is limited to 50
   occurrences in total, counting each step's initial send. Acknowledge or resolve cancels
   escalation. Eligible user recipients are active members of the alert's org with no site or
   device-group restriction, or active users of its partner with access to all orgs or
   selected access including that org.
   Validate targets on save and recheck against the alert's org when firing. An org-scope
   caller can see and newly add only that org's eligible members; partner targets already
   saved by a partner-scope caller survive its edits. Partner/system callers can also pick
   eligible partner users; a partner-wide policy's picker lists every active partner user,
   with org access checked at delivery. **Product owner confirmation pending**
   (HO-20260919-alerting-consolidation Q1).

### Config policy editor

One tab, **Monitors** (`#monitors`), replacing Alerts (`#alert_rule`), Service & Process
Monitoring (`#monitoring`) and the `alert.triggered` half of Automations. Old hashes 301 to
`#monitors`.

Contents:

- **Attached monitors** — the W02 table (enable, per-policy override, sort), plus **Attach
  existing**, **Create monitor** (opens the editor with *Deploy to: this policy* pre-set — the
  spec-promised affordance that never shipped), and the **Recommended** strip when none of the
  built-ins are attached.
- **Agent collection** — one field: *Check interval* (`checkIntervalSeconds`, 10–3600, default
  60), the only per-policy agent setting the watches carried. Stored on the existing
  `config_policy_monitoring_settings` row, re-keyed to the `monitors` feature link (see Data).
- **Needs conversion** (W05c only) — a panel listing this policy's unretired inline alert rules,
  watches and alert-triggered automations, each with a **preview** and **Convert**, plus
  **Convert all convertible**. Unconvertible rows show the reason and a **Retire** action. The
  panel disappears when the policy has nothing left; the tab never shows it on a fresh policy.
- **Duplicate warning** (W05a, transitional) — "This policy also has an inline alert rule for CPU;
  devices will alert twice" on both the Monitors tab and the legacy Alerts tab until converted.

**Automations** tab is relabelled **Jobs** and limited to `schedule`, `manual`, `webhook`
triggers. Its `alert.triggered` items are converted in W05c (see Conversion).

### Jobs

`/jobs` keeps its tabs. `#event-rules` is relabelled **Alert workflows** and its editor gains the
typed trigger filter: *severities* (multi), *monitor kinds* (multi), both optional. The
`alert.triggered` payload gains `monitorId` and `kind` (`alertService.ts:260-267, 389-399`) so
the filter has something to match. Free-form `filter` records remain accepted on the API for
compatibility; the compiler's `{ruleId}` filter is unchanged. Managed (monitor-compiled)
automations stay hidden here, as today.

### Device page

The **Monitoring** hash tab replaces the watches-only view with the device's **effective
monitors**: monitor, kind, source policy, state (ok / breaching / unknown), open episode,
escalation status, and the reset action for a latched pair. Data from `resolveMonitorsForDevice`
+ `monitor_device_state` + `monitor_episodes`. (Promised by the 09-08 spec, never delivered.)

### Removed screens and routes

| Surface | Fate | Wave |
|---|---|---|
| `/settings/alert-templates`, `/settings/alert-templates/:id` | Deleted; 301 → `/alerts/monitors`. Editor cannot produce a firing rule today, so nothing that runs is lost. Unmanaged rows are converted where a real condition exists, else retired with reason. | W05c (freeze create in W05a) |
| `/alerts/rules` (Legacy rules page) | Absorbed into the Monitors "Needs conversion" filter in W05c; route deleted in W05d. | W05c / W05d |
| `/alerts/channels`, `/alerts/routing-rules` | 301 → `/alerts/delivery`. | W05b |
| Policy `#alert_rule`, `#monitoring` tabs | Frozen for new rows in W05a; replaced by the Needs-conversion panel in W05c; hash redirects in W05d. | W05a → W05d |
| `AlertRuleEditPage`, `AlertRuleEditor`, orphaned `hub.*` i18n keys, `/monitoring/*` redirect stubs | Deleted. | W05a |
| `POST/PUT/DELETE /alerts/rules*`, `/alert-templates*` (unmanaged writes) | 410 Gone with a pointer to `/monitor-definitions`. Reads stay until W05d. | W05d |

## Data model

No new tenant-scoped tables. New columns only, on tables already registered in every cascade
and export-policy list; each new column is classified in `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` in the
same PR (`included` for scalars, `excludedOpen` for any jsonb).

**Retirement columns** (W05c), on `config_policy_alert_rules`, `config_policy_monitoring_watches`,
`alert_rules`, `alert_templates`, `automations`, `config_policy_automations`:

```
retired_at             timestamptz null
retired_reason         text null          -- 'converted' | 'unconvertible:<code>' | 'operator'
converted_to_monitor_id uuid null references monitor_definitions(id) on delete set null
```

Evaluators, resolvers and list endpoints add `retired_at IS NULL`. Alert history joins are
untouched (`alerts.rule_id`, `alerts.config_policy_id` keep resolving).

**Routing** (W05b), on `notification_routing_rules`:

```
escalation_policy_id   uuid null references escalation_policies(id) on delete set null
is_default             boolean not null default false
```

Partial unique index: one `is_default` row per `(org_id)` and one per `(partner_id)` where the
other axis is null. `conditions` gains `monitorKinds?: string[]`; `conditionTypes` and
`deviceTags` are removed from the API schema (never UI-authored, never evaluated). A migration
reports the count of rows carrying either key (`RAISE WARNING`) and leaves the jsonb as is; the
dispatcher ignores unknown keys.

**Monitors** (W05c):

- `MONITOR_KINDS` gains `composite`. Condition schema
  `{ match: 'all' | 'any', children: [{ kind, condition }] (2..10) }`, cross-validated
  child-by-child. **Children are restricted to server-evaluated kinds** (`cpu`, `memory`,
  `disk`, `offline`, `event_log`, `patch_compliance`, `cert_expiry`, `bandwidth`, `disk_io`,
  `network_errors`, `antivirus`, `software_presence`, `backup_continuity`): agent-delivered and
  worker-provisioned kinds (`service`, `process`, `process_resource`, `script`, `network_check`)
  are selected by root kind when the agent config, script probe and network rows are built
  (`helpers.ts:2109`, `monitorScriptWorker.ts:174`, `monitorCompiler.ts:306`), so a composite
  child of those kinds would never receive evidence. `toAlertCondition` returns
  `{ logic: match === 'all' ? 'and' : 'or', conditions: children.map(spec.toAlertCondition) }`.
  No nesting. `overridableKeys: []` (the override path replaces the root node wholesale,
  `alertService.ts:943-952`; an empty overridable set is the honest contract). Existing OR or
  nested groups (the standalone-rule API accepts arbitrary `conditions`, `routes/alerts/
  schemas.ts:29`) convert only when they are one flat `any` group; deeper trees are
  `unconvertible:nested_group`.
- `service` / `process` / `network_check` `consecutiveFailures` widens to `1..100` to match the
  watch domain (`validators/index.ts:941` vs `monitors.ts:79`); no watch is unconvertible on
  range.
- The `monitors` feature link gains an `inheritance` setting, `'cumulative' | 'replace'`
  (default `cumulative`, stored on the link's `inline_settings`). `replace` makes
  `resolveMonitorsForDevice` treat that policy's attachment set the way every other feature is
  resolved — closest policy wins, parent attachments not consulted — which is what a converted
  child policy needs to reproduce its inline behavior exactly (see Conversion). The policy
  Monitors tab exposes it as one switch: *Add to inherited monitors / Replace inherited
  monitors*.
- `restart_service` action params gain `maxAttempts`, `cooldownSeconds`; the agent watch builder
  (`routes/agents/helpers.ts:2137-2157`) reads them instead of `MONITOR_WATCH_DEFAULTS`.
- `checkIntervalSeconds` stays on `config_policy_monitoring_settings` keyed by the `monitoring`
  link **until W05d**: the agent config builder joins that link only (`helpers.ts:2305-2312`)
  and re-keying earlier would drop unconverted watches from the wire. In W05c the Monitors
  tab's *Check interval* writes through to that row (creating an empty-watch `monitoring` link
  if the policy has none). W05d's migration re-keys the row to the `monitors` link, the
  `monitors` inline settings gain `checkIntervalSeconds`, and the `monitoring` feature's
  decompose/assemble paths are deleted.

**Config feature types** (W05d): `alert_rule` and `monitoring` are removed from
`CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` and listed in a new `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` (shared constants).
The Postgres enum keeps the values (retired links still exist). `featureTypeParity.test.ts`,
`DeviceEffectiveConfigTab.featureParity.test.ts` and `policyBaselineDefaults.test.ts` are
changed to assert parity over `CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES` minus nothing, and that every retired type
has no tab.

## Delivery resolution

One function, `resolveDelivery(alert-ish) → { channelIds, escalationPolicyId, source }`, in
`services/delivery/resolveDelivery.ts`, used by the dispatcher, by the monitor editor's preview
endpoint (`GET /alerts/delivery/resolve?orgId&severity&kind&siteId&monitorId`), and by the
Delivery page's "test this rule set" affordance. Precedence, in order, first hit wins:

1. Monitor `deliveryMode = 'none'` → inbox only, `source: monitor`.
2. Monitor `deliveryMode = 'channels'` → its channels; escalation resolves independently below.
3. Monitor `deliveryMode = 'inherit'` (and every non-monitor alert) → routing rows for the
   alert's org and its partner, ordered `priority ASC` with org rows before partner rows at
   equal priority, non-default rows first; match on severities, monitorKinds, siteIds (site
   rules fail closed as today).
4. The org's `is_default` row if present, else the partner's `is_default` row.
5. No default row (fresh install with no channels) → inbox only, logged.

In-app notifications remain unconditional (step 0). **Escalation resolves independently of
channels**: the monitor's own `escalationPolicyId` if set (today `inherit` + explicit escalation
already works, `notificationDispatcher.ts:443`), then an unretired legacy source's explicit
policy during the transition, then the winning routing row's policy, then null (D22). Monitor
`deliveryMode = 'none'` suppresses escalation too. Empty eligible channels alone do not suppress
escalation. W05d removes the legacy arm, leaving `monitor → row → null`.
The all-enabled-channels fallback is deleted.

**`channelIds` means eligible destinations** (decided 2026-09-19 after the plan cross-check): the
resolver itself drops ineligible channels and reports them as
`skippedChannelIds: [{ id, reason: 'disabled' | 'unavailable' }]` — `unavailable` covers missing,
foreign-tenant and not-visible alike, so a foreign channel id is indistinguishable from a
nonexistent one (no cross-tenant existence oracle). Eligibility is ordinary RLS-scoped reads plus an
explicit owner predicate applied identically in dispatch and preview; no `SECURITY DEFINER`
function and no scope escalation (D21, quorum 2026-09-19; the partner-wide SELECT branches these
tables need already shipped in `2026-10-10-120000`). Dispatch and preview use that same
resolved destination set; the preview shows the skipped ones. Dispatch warns about skipped
channels with the alert, org, source, rule and reasons, logs skipped user targets, and drops
and logs a send if transport options cannot be loaded. An inbox-only channel result still
schedules any resolved escalation.

**Transitional (W05b → W05d):** after monitor channel settings and before routing, honour an
unretired legacy source's non-empty channel override —
`alert_rules.overrideSettings.notificationChannelIds` or
`config_policy_alert_rules.notification_channel_ids`. Its explicit escalation policy takes
precedence over routing even when its channels are inherited, so nothing changes for a rule
until it is converted. W05d deletes this legacy arm; that is where any remaining legacy
explicit escalation stops applying, and its source must already be converted or retired.

**Migration** (`2026-…-delivery-default-rows.sql`, system scope): for every partner with ≥1
**enabled** partner-wide channel, insert a partner `is_default` row with those channels; for
every org with ≥1 **enabled** org-owned channel, insert an org `is_default` row with the org's
enabled channels **plus** its partner's enabled partner-wide channels (that is exactly the
fallback query at `notificationDispatcher.ts:362-371`, `enabled = true` on both axes). Report both
counts. Day one is behavior-identical. Release notes state the one change: *new channels are not
subscribed to anything until added to a routing row.*

## Conversion

Every legacy source becomes a monitor definition owned on the **same axis as the source's
policy** (org-owned policy → org monitor; partner-wide policy → partner monitor), attached to
that policy, and the source row is retired in the same transaction. A ledger records it in
**two new tables**: `monitor_conversions` `{id, org_id XOR partner_id, source_table, source_id,
policy_id, converted_by, converted_at, preview_hash, reverted_at}` and
`monitor_conversion_outputs` `{conversion_id, monitor_id, role ('primary' | 'resource_cpu' |
'resource_memory' | 'response'), moved_alert_ids jsonb}` — a watch can produce up to three
monitors. Both are org-XOR-partner (partner-wide playbook shape, SELECT-only partner branch),
registered in `CORE_ORG_CASCADE_DELETE_ORDER` (outputs before conversions before
`monitor_definitions`), `CORE_TENANT_EXPORT_POLICY` (`moved_alert_ids` is `excludedOpen`), and
`DUAL_AXIS_TENANT_TABLES` in the same PR. Any composite FK that carries `org_id` is `DEFERRABLE
INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`. Conversion is idempotent on `(source_table, source_id)`; **Revert** on a
ledger row un-retires the source, deletes the output monitors (attachments cascade) and restores
`alerts.rule_id`/`config_policy_id` for `moved_alert_ids`. The source row's
`converted_to_monitor_id` holds the primary output.

**Source visibility before the ledger write (D29).** The live-conversion unique index
(`monitor_conversions_live_source_uidx` on `(source_table, source_id) WHERE reverted_at IS NULL`)
is **global, not tenant-scoped**, and `source_id` carries no FK. Every writer of a ledger row
(`convertPolicy`, `convertPartnerLegacy`, `retireSource`, W05e's network adoption) must first load
the source row through the **caller's own RLS context** and refuse 404-shaped when it is not
visible — never let the insert answer with 23505. Otherwise a caller could squat another
tenant's source slot and probe which source ids exist.

**Retired rows are never deleted (D11 generalised, D29).** The `config_policy_*` children are
`ON DELETE CASCADE` from `config_policy_feature_links`, so a feature link that owns any row with
`retired_at IS NOT NULL` (alert rules, automations, monitoring watches) is **kept**: removing the
feature deletes the live rows, saves an empty item set, and the route/AI tool answer
`{ success: true, kept: true, reason: 'retired_history' }`. `assembleInlineSettings` returns the
authoritative empty set **only** for a link with at least one retired row; a link with mirror
JSON and zero normalized rows and zero retired rows still falls back to the mirror (pre-backfill
links). Until the converter's open-alert carry-over re-keys open alerts to the monitor in the
conversion transaction (W05c1 PR 3), an alert queued before its source was retired resolves
default delivery and loses that source's escalation — PR 3 closes the window.

| Source | Becomes | Mapping notes | Unconvertible when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config_policy_alert_rules` row, 1 condition | monitor of the matching kind | existing `convertAlertConditionToMonitor`; `escalation_policy_id` → monitor escalation; `notification_channel_ids` non-empty → `deliveryMode: channels`, empty/null → `inherit` (never `none`); `cooldown`, `autoResolve`, severity, name, rationale → description | metric `processCount`/`processes` (no kind); `custom` |
| `config_policy_alert_rules` row, 2–10 conditions | `composite` monitor | children through the same converter | any child unconvertible |
| `config_policy_monitoring_watches` row | `service` or `process` monitor; **plus** a `process_resource` monitor per set threshold (`cpuThresholdPercent`, `memoryThresholdMb`) | `alertAfterConsecutiveFailures` → `consecutiveFailures`; `autoRestart` → `restart_service` response with `maxAttempts`/`cooldownSeconds` from the row; `thresholdDurationSeconds` → `durationMinutes` (rounded up) on the resource monitor; `alertOnStop` and `alertSeverity` ignored (stored, never read at runtime — mapping them would *change* behavior) | never (all fields map) |
| `config_policy_monitoring_settings.checkIntervalSeconds` | policy Monitors tab *Check interval* | row re-keyed, not converted | — |
| `alert_templates` unmanaged + its `alert_rules` | monitor + attachment to a **new policy** assigned to the rule's target (existing `ruleConversionService` path: `createConfigPolicy`, `assignPolicy`, `addFeatureLink`) | existing converter | template `conditions` is the editor envelope (no `type`) — retired with reason `unconvertible:no_condition`. Exception: templates the compliance bridge fires directly (`policyAlertBridge.ts:230`, sourced alerts, no evaluator) are **not** alert-rule templates and are left alone |
| `automations` / `config_policy_automations` with `trigger.event = 'alert.triggered'` | if `filter.ruleId` or `filter.configPolicyAlertRuleId` names a source being converted → appended to that monitor's `responses` (device-bound, dedup by action fingerprint); otherwise → **kept** as an Alert workflow under Jobs with `filter` left as is (policy-scoped ones are re-homed to a standalone automation assigned to the same policy) | actions carried verbatim (max 10 per monitor) | never |

**Inheritance correction.** Inline `alert_rule` is whole-feature-replace: role/OS filters,
then level, assignment priority, creation time, one winning feature
(`configurationPolicy.ts:2434-2506`). Monitors are cumulative, rank a policy's own attachment
ahead of inherited ones before priority, and accumulate across unrelated assignments
(`monitorResolver.ts:73-81`). Attaching parent monitors to a child with `enabled: false` cannot
reproduce that. The converter therefore does not try to emulate replacement with attachments;
it **sets `inheritance: 'replace'` on the `monitors` link of every converted policy that had
its own inline `alert_rule` feature**, and the resolver (with the prerequisite filter fix)
selects that policy's attachment set exactly as the legacy resolver selected its feature. A
tech flips the switch to `cumulative` deliberately, later, per policy.

Monitor reuse across policies (attach an existing monitor instead of minting one) happens only
on **full behavioral equivalence**: kind, normalized condition, severity, cooldown, auto-resolve,
delivery and responses all equal. Otherwise a new monitor is created.

**Equivalence check.** The preview is not a sample: for every device in the policy's assignment
scope it computes the legacy effective condition set (`previewEffectiveConfig`) and the
post-conversion set (`resolveMonitorsForDevice` on the proposed attachments, in a dry-run
transaction) and refuses when any device gains or loses an active condition or changes
severity, cooldown or delivery. Above 500 devices the check runs as a job and the panel shows
progress; the ledger stores the `preview_hash` so a stale preview cannot be confirmed.

**Open alerts.** Alert status is `active | acknowledged | resolved | suppressed | dismissed`;
dedupe considers `active, acknowledged, suppressed` (`alertService.ts:202-206`); legacy
auto-resolve keys on `config_policy_id IS NOT NULL` (`:1393-1397`) and cooldown resolution
prefers `config_policy_id` (`:744-748`). For every non-terminal alert of a converted source
the converter, in the same transaction: sets `alerts.rule_id` to the compiled rule, sets
`alerts.config_policy_id = NULL`, records the source id in `alerts.context.convertedFrom`
(history and the detail page read it), and lists the ids in the ledger's `moved_alert_ids`.
Cooldown state keyed `cpar:<source>:<device>` is re-keyed to the compiled rule's key. The alert
is then deduped, cooled and auto-resolved by the monitor path only.

**Other writers of legacy rows** (all changed in W05c so conversion is not undone):

| Writer | Today | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding `modules/mcpInvites/tools/configureDefaults.ts:142` | inserts unmanaged baseline `alert_rules` per org | attaches the partner's built-in monitors to the org's default policy |
| `scripts/migrateToConfigPolicies.ts:397` | recreates inline `config_policy_alert_rules` | script retired (W05d) |
| Fleet Designer `fleetDesign/apply.ts:309-371` | writes `alert_rule` and `monitoring` links | writes monitor attachments |
| AI `manage_policy_feature_link` | writes both legacy features | refuses (W05d), points at `manage_monitor_definitions` |

**Who runs it.**

- W05c ships the per-policy panel and a partner-level **Convert everything** action (preview
  → confirm), gated on `canManagePartnerWidePolicies` for partner-wide rows.
- Hosted: we run the partner-level action for every partner after deploy, from the admin UI,
  and record the ledger counts in the release checklist.
- Self-hosted: an admin banner on `/alerts/monitors` and the policy Monitors tab counts unretired
  rows from W05c on. W05d's migration runs the converter in system scope for whatever remains
  and retires the unconvertible rows with reasons; the banner then lists them once
  ("3 legacy rules could not be converted — review") until dismissed. Nothing stops firing
  without being listed.

## Evaluation

- W05a–W05c: both sweeps run; the duplicate warning is the only mitigation, and the converter's
  atomic retire-and-attach means no policy is ever double-evaluated after conversion.
- W05d: `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy` is deleted along with `alertService.ts:1239-1310`, the
  `cpar:` cooldown keys and the `config_policy_id` branch of the acknowledge handler
  (`routes/alerts/alerts.ts:1082-1088`) become history-only reads. A startup check counts
  `config_policy_alert_rules WHERE retired_at IS NULL`; a non-zero count logs at error level,
  reports to Sentry and raises the admin banner. The W05d migration makes it zero; the check
  exists so a skipped or failed migration is loud, not silent.

## Tenancy and safety

- No new RLS shape. `monitor_conversions` is org-XOR-partner (shape 1 + partner branch, with the
  SELECT-only partner-wide branch per the playbook); everything else is columns on registered
  tables.
- Monitors created by conversion are inserted through `createMonitorDefinition`/
  `compileMonitorInTx` under the caller's `withDbAccessContext` (panel) or per-partner
  `withSystemDbAccessContext` (W05d migration and hosted sweep), never a bare pool.
- `monitorAttachability` already refuses cross-partner attachment and partner monitors that
  reference org-only escalation policies; the converter surfaces those as `unconvertible:
  escalation_policy_axis` instead of dropping the policy silently.
- Routing default rows are dual-owned like every delivery rail (#2130); the resolver uses
  `railOwnershipCondition` unchanged.
- `partner-wide-write-coverage.test.ts` and `site-ceiling-write-coverage.test.ts` need allowlist
  entries with reasons for the new partner-axis writers (conversion, default rows).

## AI / MCP tools

| Tool | Change | Wave |
|---|---|---|
| `manage_policy_feature_link` | refuses `featureType: alert_rule` / `monitoring` with a pointer to `manage_monitor_definitions` | W05c (warn) / W05d (refuse) |
| `manage_alert_rules` | `list_templates` removed; `list_rules` returns managed rules only | W05d |
| `manage_service_monitors` | `list` reads service/process monitors via the resolver | W05c |
| `manage_notification_channels` | gains `manage_routing` / `manage_escalation_policies` actions, or a new `manage_delivery` tool (decide in plan; one home) | W05b |
| Fleet Designer `apply.ts:309-371` | writes `monitors` attachments instead of `alert_rule` / `monitoring` links; `fleetDesign.ts` rule schema becomes a monitor-definition subset | W05c |

## Docs and release notes

`features/alerts.mdx` becomes the domain page (three facets); `alert-templates.mdx` and
`service-monitoring.mdx` are removed with redirects; `monitors.mdx`, `notifications.mdx`,
`configuration-policies.mdx` updated; the nine `migration/*.mdx` guides re-point "alert rule"
instructions to monitors. Release notes per wave carry: the delivery default change (W05b), the
conversion instructions and deadline (W05c), the removals and the boot check (W05d).

## Waves

| Wave | Ships | Gate to next |
|---|---|---|
| **W05a — stop the bleeding** (2 PRs, no schema) | Delete false hint; duplicate-condition warning on policy Monitors and Alerts tabs; **Create monitor** and Recommended strip on the policy Monitors tab; freeze creation on policy Alerts tab, S&P tab and Alert Templates (existing rows still editable; "converts in the next release" notice); remove `conditionTypes`/`deviceTags` from the routing API schema; delete orphaned `AlertRuleEditPage`/`AlertRuleEditor`/`hub.*` keys/`/monitoring/*` stubs; add a *superseded* banner to the 09-08 spec | merged |
| **W05b — delivery** (3 PRs) | `resolveDelivery` + preview endpoint; routing `escalation_policy_id`, `is_default`, `monitorKinds`; default-row migration; Delivery page (Channels · Routing · Escalation policies) with `/alerts/channels` redirect; monitor Notify card shows resolved inheritance; dispatcher on the resolver; fallback deleted; delivery MCP tool | one integration test proving dispatch and preview agree for org-row, partner-row, default-row and inbox-only cases against real Postgres |
| **W05c — conversion** (5 PRs; requires the three prerequisite fixes merged) | `composite` kind; `inheritance` link setting + resolver; `consecutiveFailures` widening; `restart_service` params + agent builder; Check-interval write-through; retirement columns; `monitor_conversions`; converter for all five sources incl. inheritance correction and open-alert carry-over; per-policy panel + partner-level Convert everything; Needs-conversion filter on Monitors; Alert workflows filter + payload fields; device page Monitoring tab; Fleet Designer and AI-tool changes; Alert Templates pages deleted | hosted: ledger shows zero unretired rows on EU and US; self-hosted banner live |
| **W05d — retirement** (2 PRs, ≥1 release after W05c) | Migration runs the converter in system scope for leftovers; settings re-key to the `monitors` link; transitional delivery overrides removed; `migrateToConfigPolicies` script deleted; policy `#alert_rule`/`#monitoring` tabs, `/alerts/rules`, legacy routers (410), `monitoring` feature decompose/assemble, `evaluateDeviceAlertsFromPolicy` deleted; `RETIRED_CONFIG_FEATURE_TYPES`; boot check | — |
| **W05e — network checks** (3 PRs; requires #6352, #6353 merged) | Network Monitor → **Network** (Assets · Templates · Results); check authoring in Monitors (kind `network_check`, bound to an asset); unmanaged `network_monitors` rows are **adopted** in place (stamped `managed_by_monitor_id`, keeping row id, results history and asset binding) rather than re-inserted, under the same ledger; their `network_monitor_alert_rules` retired; one generated "Network checks — <org>" policy per org carries the attachments | — |

W05a and W05b are independent of each other. W05c depends on both. W05d depends on W05c having
shipped in a prior release. W05e is separable and may be re-planned after W05d.

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Conversion changes what fires for some device (inheritance, thresholds, delivery) | Preview computes before/after per sample device and refuses on any delta; ledger + retired rows allow reverting a single conversion (`un-retire` action, W05c) |
| Delivery default row misses a channel the fallback used to hit | Migration derives rows from the exact fallback query; integration test replays the dispatcher on a fixture partner before/after |
| Self-hosters skip W05c and land on W05d | W05d migration converts leftovers itself; unconvertible rows are listed, never silent; the startup count check logs, reports and banners rather than evaluating nothing quietly |
| Composite override semantics surprise | Composite has no overridable keys; the policy row shows "override not available for composite monitors" |
| Watches with thresholds become two monitors | Preview shows both; names derive from the watch (`"<name> — CPU"`) |
| Fleet Designer and AI tools keep writing legacy features | Both are changed in W05c and the legacy write paths refuse in W05d; `aiAgentSdkTools.mcpCoverage.test.ts` pins the tool surface |
| Alert history loses provenance | Rows are retired, never deleted; moved alerts carry `context.convertedFrom`; detail page shows "converted to monitor X" |
| `inheritance: replace` surprises a tech who later attaches a partner-wide monitor to a parent | The policy Monitors tab shows the switch state and, in replace mode, lists the inherited monitors being ignored |
| A prerequisite fix slips and conversion proceeds | The converter refuses to run unless the three fixes' feature checks pass (a startup-registered capability list), and the panel says which is missing |

## Review log

- 2026-09-19 — Fable position: retire outright, assisted conversion, explicit delivery default.
  Codex gpt-6-astra xhigh (read-only) independently: "retire the competing authoring models;
  make Monitors canonical; thin pointers only during migration; reject an unconditional
  backfill", and added the inheritance-semantics trap, the watch-field parity gap, the
  open-alert continuity requirement, and "do not retire every alert.triggered automation —
  broad ones change coverage if copied per monitor". All four adopted above (Inheritance
  correction, C9, Open alerts, C7). Codex's end-state tab lists match §End state.
- 2026-09-19 (second round, written spec) — Codex xhigh found ten defects in the draft; all
  verified in code and adopted: offline-monitor firing gap, restart discriminator loss and
  resolver filter gap (now *Prerequisite defects*); delivery must not change for unconverted
  rules and escalation must resolve independently of channel inheritance (§Delivery
  resolution); parent-suppression could not emulate whole-feature replacement (now the
  `inheritance: replace` link setting + full-scope equivalence check); open-alert carry-over
  had the wrong statuses and left `config_policy_id` live (rewritten); settings re-key would
  have dropped unconverted watches (deferred to W05d); composite children must be
  server-evaluated kinds and OR groups exist (restricted + `match`); onboarding and the
  migrate script write legacy rows (inventoried); `consecutiveFailures` domains differ
  (widened); ledger could not hold one-to-many (outputs table).
- 2026-09-19 (W05e planning) — the wave plan adopts legacy `network_monitors` rows in place
  instead of insert-and-retire (keeps ids, history, TLS observations); accepted and recorded in
  §Waves. Two shipped W04 defects surfaced and were filed (#6352, #6353).
- Owner (2026-09-19): framing approved — "alerting is the purpose in an RMM; monitors serve
  it"; Monitors name kept; explicit delivery default with opt-in new channels approved.

## Out of scope — file as issues at plan time

- `routingRulesFor` site fail-closed semantics review (unchanged here).
- Alert-category taxonomy for AI-agent triggers (`aiAgents.ts:134`) vs monitor kinds — unify
  later.
- `processCount` metric: add a `process_count` kind or drop; data-dependent.
- Per-org overrides of partner monitors beyond `enabled`/threshold keys.
